You don't want to miss out on the 4th edition of European Testing Conference. The edition is packed with great practical lessons on how we do testing in today's organizations, and its founded on the deep learning on conference organizing we have from these years. We've grown to learn that we are different in how we look at collaboration - we work together in new innovative ways to bring you the best program.

We are delighted to announce that <a href="https://ti.to/ETC/ETC19">tickets for the 2019 conference in Valencia Spain on February 14-15 are now available</a>.

The ticket categories have both a timeframe and a quota on their availability.

  * **Super Early Bird Tickets** (749 Euros) is available until Mid-September or until 30 people have used the opportunity.
  * **Early Bird Tickets** (849 Euros) is available until Mid-November or until 40 people have used the opportunity.
  * **Regular Tickets** (1049 Euros) are available until the conference or until we are full with 200 people.

  You may be thinking that our ticket prices are on the higher end, and you are right. That is by design, coming from the fact that we not only pay the speakers travel and hotel, but also share profits with them. This enables us access to very high quality speakers - and you access to high quality learning.

  The conference organizers are a group of speakers and practitioning professionals. We take your learning seriously - with a twist of fun to reinforce what we're learning.

  See you at European Testing Conference 2019!



  <i>In the spirit of transparency to help you make your choices, here's a summary of our whole ticket pricing idea. We will have 7 European Diversity Tickets available for free through Travis Foundation. Two of them come with a travel scholarship. We use discount codes available for old speakers to encourage their return, speakers we could not fit into the program this year to encourage them joining, and to particular South-European markets to bring down ticket prices they find preventive. Feel free to <a href="mailto:contact@europeantestingconference.eu">get in touch</a> if our communications have not reached you and you are on these groups.
