The year 2018 and thus European Testing Conference 2018 is approaching. Shall we meet in Amsterdam on February 19-20th?

There's been a small change in our program, making it even more awesome and worthwhile to attend. Jessica Kerr has pressing reasons to cancel her appearance this year, and we replaced her with Pamela Gay, an American astronomer, a true inspiration.

Join us in Amsterdam and get your ticket today. All speakers have special discount codes, and they would love for you to reach out to them to introduce yourself in advance and ask for the code.
