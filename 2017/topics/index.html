<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p><a href="http://europeantestingconference.eu/slides17/FionaCharles.pdf">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>It used to be a lot easier to build a software testing career. That was yesterday, when expectations about testing were shared across the industry.</p>

<p>Of course there were variations. Not every workplace had a dedicated team of skilled testers and not every piece of software was tested with the same degree of rigor. But fundamentally, most software creators and integrators agreed that all software needed to be tested before release, and that the more highly skilled testers doing the work, the better.</p>

<p>Now, software daily increases its hold on the world, and we continually devise different ways to create and implement it, as well as embracing sophisticated tools for assisting every stage of the process. There is no longer a robust dominant paradigm of software testing. Our expectations of how to test, when to test, who should test — even whether we need to test at all — keep changing with new methods and technology.</p>

<p>Contemporary software is staggeringly varied, from simple risk-free apps pitched to a wide consumer base to increasingly complex systems that could kill people, like those operating autonomous cars.</p>

<p>How we deal with this exciting and ever-changing world has major implications for every tester and indeed for the world: in the value we can bring to projects and teams, but also in how we manage our careers, how we train up and coming testers, what skills we learn and teach.</p>

<p>How will you multiply your odds for thriving as a software tester? Join Fiona Charles to explore the possibilities in this world of many paradigms.</p>

<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p>Standing by who you are, having the courage to be different, making yourself vulnerable, speaking up when there is something important to you, sharing your fears and joys requires courage.</p>

<p>Courage is individual and there is no such thing as a little courage.</p>

<p>Being brave is not about removing fear or not being afraid – it is about doing what is necessary even when you are afraid.</p>

<p>I live this personally; I have to be brave (even have a tattoo with it).  I will never go back. And it is a big learning I try to pass on to the people, I coach. I will talk about why I have to be brave and vulnerable, give examples of how I am courageous, and why being brave is a big part of my work life.</p>

<p><a href="http://europeantestingconference.eu/slides17/NicolaSedgewick.pdf">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>Throughout my career I’ve been involved in projects where the tunnel vision of team members may create product of apparently great quality but may entirely miss their spot in the market or the problem being solved. A source of frustration for me has been trying to get team-mates to look outside of the project bubble and I am now having success doing this through the medium of games and challenges. My next move is to start publicising and teaching methods that I use to help my own testing work - for instance, improving exploratory testing charters by taking inspiration from a method that David Bowie used for creating his song lyrics.</p>

	<h3 class="title"><a href="/2017/speakers#abby-bangser-bhagya-perera">Abby Bangser and Bhagya Perera</a> - Insights into Distributed Development</h3>
	

	

	


<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p><a href="http://europeantestingconference.eu/slides17/AbbyBhagya.pdf">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>Distributed development is becoming the new normal. The continual improvement on collaboration tools allows for organisations to find the right person for the job as much as employees to find the right career opportunity with a lot less focus on location.</p>

<p>But distribution does not mean just one team style. There are both examples of both successful and struggling teams in many different formats such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Offshore: a single role, typically developer or tester, in a different location from the rest of the team</li>
  <li>Remote: a team that’s members are able to work from home, this may be everyone or only select members</li>
  <li>Distributed: complete teams with programmers, testers, analysts and others present in each of the global locations</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependencies among delivery team members in different locations usually means that no one location has complete control over product quality. This leads to significant challenges around not only time and cultural differences but also in integration and delivery accountability.</p>

<p>In this workshop, Bhagya and Abby will examine the obstacles faced by both onshore and offshore teams. For example, onshore teams need to negotiate scope and feel the in-person client pressures. Offshore teams have vague requirements they have to piece together, and may be blocked due to lack of access to product owners or business analysts to answer questions.</p>

<p>Through a fast paced hands-on simulation, this workshop will generate ideas for how to improve communication, empathy and in turn productivity and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Real time evaluation of emotional, physical and mental experiences by both onshore and offshore employees</li>
  <li>Ideas to work around the impediments distributed teams face as they strive to build quality into their product</li>
  <li>Ways to turn disadvantages of distributed teams into positive benefits</li>

	<h3 class="title"><a href="/2017/speakers#angie-jones">Angie Jones</a> - How to Get Automation Included In Your Definition of Done</h3>
	

	

	


<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p><a href="http://slides.com/angiejones/in-sprint-automation"> [Slides]</a></p>

<p>While most teams appreciate the benefits of automation, it is commonly viewed as too time-consuming to be considered as part of an agile sprint - resulting in automation being done in isolation and typically months after the story has been closed. This can lead to several problems including automation team members being disengaged and missing key aspects of the requirements, as well as teams going through a period where new features are being introduced but no regression testing is occurring.</p>

<p>In this interactive workshop, you’ll learn agile-friendly approaches to test automation that will enable you to work smarter - not harder - to close your sprints with automation in place. You’ll apply these techniques to an example sprint story, learn how to collaborate with other stakeholders to ensure automation interests are considered, and will leave empowered to demonstrate to your teams how it is possible to accomplish in-sprint automation.</p>

<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p>Unit testing is as important in the JavaScript world as anywhere else and the community has created a great ecosystem over the last years. However, it also lacks the standard library people are used to from other languages, making it harder to get started both for programming beginners as well as people switching from other ecosystems. For this workshop we’ll skip this tedious part, work with a prepared toolchain and jump straight into practicing testing skills on a JS kata. We’ll work in multiple sessions with changing pairs so we can adapt to the participants skill levels during the workshop, so the session should be valuable both for people that write code in JS and want to get started with writing tests as well as advanced programmers that are already driving all their JS code test-first.</p>

<p><a href="http://europeantestingconference.eu/slides17/Damian-pdf">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>“By words we learn thoughts, and by thoughts we learn life.” – Jean Baptiste Girard</p>

<p>How are concepts conveyed? How are thoughts shared? One way is by using words. But, which words should you use? And how can you tell if your words effectively convey your thoughts? What causes miscommunication, what are its effects, and how can you avoid it? And what are the benefits and limitations of a shared language? In this workshop, we will collaborate, explore, and analyze previous instances of this workshop to understand and answer these questions, and many more. Starting with the definition of definition, we will investigate words and meaning, their properties, and their relationship. We will then examine how miscommunication can occur, look at some potential consequences of it, and explore some methods to minimize it. Finally, we will analyze the difficulty of creating a shared language, even in a microcosm. In the end, attendees will gain new knowledge and tools to help them more effectively transfer ideas with words.</p>

<p>Workshop Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deeper understanding of the meaning of words and meaning.</li>
  <li>Some causes and effects of miscommunication and practical techniques to avoid it.</li>
  <li>The difficulty of creating a shared language.</li>

	<h3 class="title"><a href="/2017/speakers#emily-bache">Emily Bache</a> - Introduction to Approval Testing with TextTest</h3>
	

	

	


<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p>Most automated tests follow an overall structure ‘Arrange, Act, Assert’. It’s that assertion part that is different in approval testing. When you design a test with assertions, you have to carefully decide which things are important to check. The thing is, if you don’t anticipate all the failure modes, tests can pass and bugs can slip through unnoticed.</p>

<p>In Approval testing, you generally take an opposite standpoint - by default everything is interesting, and everything will be checked. When a test designer automates an acceptance test scenario, they will ‘Approve’ the whole program output, or explicitly decide some parts to filter out first.

<p><p>Most automated tests follow an overall structure ‘Arrange, Act, Assert’. It’s that assertion part that is different in approval testing. When you design a test with assertions, you have to carefully decide which things are important to check. The thing is, if you don’t anticipate all the failure modes, tests can pass and bugs can slip through unnoticed.</p>

<p>In Approval testing, you generally take an opposite standpoint - by default everything is interesting, and everything will be checked. When a test designer automates an acceptance test scenario, they will ‘Approve’ the whole program output, or explicitly decide some parts to filter out first. Any future deviation from the approved output will be marked as a test failure. The test designer’s responsibility is therefore reversed - all output is interesting unless they say otherwise. This kind of a test can find bugs no-one anticipated when it was written, and in my experience, this happens reasonably often.</p>

<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/adibolb/different-types-of-automated-tests">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>This talk is done in collaboration with the audience. There are many types of tests out there. Let’s see the most used types of tests and understand how each one is useful. We will write live code, and we will discuss automated tests written.</p>

<p>The types of tests covered are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unit Tests = Tests in isolation, focused on methods and classes. White box tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integration Tests = Tests about how two different modules integrate. Black box tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integrated Tests = Big, large tests showing how many modules integrate, with a business purpose. Black box tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acceptance Tests = Tests showing that an application features behaves well. Black box tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contract Tests = Special type of tests, that verify polimorphism integration of multiple components or classes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will focus on clean code, good test names that can become <a href="http://mozaicworks.com/blog/executable-specifications">executable specifications</a>.</p>

<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p><a href="http://europeantestingconference.eu/slides17/AlastairSmith.pdf">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>Learn how to make database development fun again, by applying all your favourite modern development practices to your SQL code!</p>

<p>Software is eating the world, but few apps are useful without a database behind them too. As such, we want to ensure our database code is well-designed and tested. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a good tool for software design, and as SPROCs are as much code as classes and methods, we can apply the same principles to unit test our database rather than integration test it via the app.</p>

<p>This talk will cover how to write unit tests for your database, which parts you should (and shouldn’t!) test, and how to run your tests automatically on a CI server, after which you will be able to write unit tests for your own SQL code and enjoy database development again!</p>

	<h3 class="title"><a href="/2017/speakers#alexandra-schladebeck">Alex Schladebeck</a> - Will your tests stand the test of time? Patterns for automated UI tests</h3>
	

	

	


<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p><a href="http://europeantestingconference.eu/slides17/AlexSchladebeck.pdf">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>Test automation projects can have a bad tendency to go awry, most especially when higher-level automation (e.g. via the UI) is involved. At some point, automated tests just become too hard to understand, extend and maintain.</p>

<p>This doesn’t have to be the case though. In software development, there are systematic methods and patterns for addressing recurring challenges – and similar approaches also exist for test automation.</p>

<p>In this talk, I’ll present a structured, systematic and tool-independent approach for automating UI tests. The approach and the patterns that result from it haven’t simply been invented from scratch, rather they build on and expand patterns and methodologies well-known from software development and web-testing for example.</p>

<p>During the talk, I’ll briefly explain what patterns are and why they are useful, and I’ll show examples to illustrate the structures I describe. Anyone involved in automating tests (whether they are programmers or not) can profit from learning and applying these patterns in their teams.</p>

<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B36uqsKV90-HbVVfOUlGQVdfRTQ/view?usp=sharing">[Mindmap]</a></p>

<p>Testing is about learning. We need to learn the systems, applications, and features we test. We need to learn the ways we do testing and how to use tools to help us while doing testing. Our ability to learn fast and work on partial information is often what helps us succeed as testers. We have a lot to learn from the wider knowledge base of learning that teachers apply when teaching students.</p>

<p>In this talk, we look at three specific techniques that can help you learn faster while solving some of the everyday testing problems. The techniques are based on my experience as a teacher and a trainer and are shared with the practical application of my work as a tester. You’ll learn about Focused and Diffused mode, Pomodoro technique, and Mindmaps, and get practical advice on how these can help you in your work as a tester. These techniques already have helped testers and developers at my work and in my local community to take control of their learning and learn better and faster about testing, development, or any other topic of interest.</p>

<p>The three techniques will get you to a good start on your lifelong learning and help you advance faster in your career. Don’t take learning for granted, pay attention and work on improving on it to unlock your hidden potential and help yourself in both professional and personal development.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to learn and our skills of learning have never been as important as they are now. Join me to learn how to learn faster!</p>

<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p><a href="http://europeantestingconference.eu/slides17/HuibSchoots.pdf">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>Much has been said and written about exploratory testing. Unfortunately, it appears that exploratory testing is still often misunderstood. Some claim that exploratory testing is unstructured and ad hoc. Just playing or cruising through the software clicking stuff without a plan. I think that is because it might look that way. Excellent testing done by a real professional looks easy from the outside. But what is really going on?</p>

<p>In this demo talk I will test software and while doing that, I will explain what I am doing and why. I will also give insight in the techniques, skills and tactics that are being used. There is a lot going on when we test and by narrating and framing what is going on, we create understanding. By knowing what skills and tactics we use, it helps us focus on the right things and it enables learning them. The audience will be engaged in this demo by observing and trying to figure out what is really going on on stage.</p>

<p><a href="http://europeantestingconference.eu/slides17/JoelHynoski.pdf">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>Of course you can throw lots of time and effort into doing testing of your app and infrastructure, but is it the right way to approach it? The science of the way we think and apply our knowledge to tasks shows that by approaching testing using your brainpower rather than willpower can result in better quality overall.</p>

<p>We’ve built Lyft’s testing culture from manual beginnings into an automated system using these principles of working from brainpower. Along with our core company values, automating intelligently and breaking the barriers between Test and Development have been important steps along our journey. You’ll learn how we’ve done things so far, what’s next, and how we’re keeping ourselves honest.</p>

<p>When faced with a challenge, often there are things that hold us back. They slow us down or they keep us from trying at all. And more often than we would like (or think), we ourselves are what is holding us back. We imagine problems where there are none, and by doing so create an actual problem for ourselves. We limit ourselves, because… why actually?</p>

<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p><a href="http://www.europeantestingconference.eu/slides17/JyothiRangaiah.pdf">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>Mindmaps are a great way to visualize what you know through learning, need to remember for later and to share that knowledge further. As such, they have become a favored tool to support testing. When learning for testing of a new perspective or feature, it makes sense to collect ideas in a format that allows restructuring them when you learn more. Personal mindmaps support your own thinking right now, reusable mindmaps are made to share knowledge with a wider audience over long period of time. Reusable mindmaps provide two types of value: the deep learning for their creator, and the shortcut to the topic for those reusing the mindmaps later.</p>

<p>In this talk, Jyothi shares her lessons as creator and user of reusable mindmaps and leads us into learning through her experiences. She has been a major contributor for the Test Insane mindmaps repository, having created and shared 19 reusable mindmaps. You will learn from her insights into becoming a better tester structuring your knowledge in this format, and get ideas from how even she uses these mindmaps both created by her and others to aid her testing efforts. We go through samples of different types of mindmaps with insights: ones that document test ideas for a particular common feature (e.g. search); ones that share knowledge of a specialized field of testing (e.g. mobile testing); ones that support quick learning of specific technologies (e.g. web).</p>

<p>Behind every online initiative there’s people doing the work to deliver the results to us. The end product may appear finished, but there’s been a lot of work put into making things appear simple and clear. Join me to learn from this work. Reuse of what has already been created lets you shortcut your learning into various areas of testing. But what you really want to take home from this session is Jyothi’s experience that enables you to create specific reusable mindmaps for your own organization.</p>

<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p><a href="http://www.mattplavoie.com/usability-testing/">[Materials]</a></p>

<p>Software testing is important, that is a given. But are you testing for everything? In the age of the customer it isn’t enough for software to meet functional requirements. If it’s confusing, error prone, difficult to learn or unsatisfying people aren’t going to use it. Even more challenging is the fact that we can’t dependably identify these issues since we understand how the system works.</p>

<p>Usability testing is one of the most effective ways for us to uncover usability issues in the products we work on. In this method we observe as real users interact with software and attempt to complete scenario based tasks. By prompting them with questions and watching them succeed or struggle, we can identify and address the usability problems in our products.</p>

<p>In this session we will observe a usability test first hand, learn the basics of how to conduct one, and how to incorporate it into a testing strategy.</p>

<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/secret/7ckmD6u46EUwGu">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>Mobile Testing specialist Ron is tired of conferences full of sales pitches and wants to make a difference, sharing the love for his craft.
He found a partner in mind with the European Testing Conference and packed the story of a mobile automation journey into a medieval tale with dragons, knights, and, of course, a princess to be rescued!</p>

<p>The story of the knight Sir Rawnell is about to unfold, an unsung hero who rode out to fight the dragon and save the princess. For his quest, given to him by a global leader in construction management software, he had to chose the right weapon. His account will tell you how he found Calabash to automate the end-to-end tests for an iOS &amp; Android hybrid app. The final selection was a difficult one, as you will be told, but he was happy with his choice. Alas, fierce difficulties and hardship are looming! Did he succeed in his quest? Check in to this session to find out…</p>

<p>In the second half Ron will „walk the talk“ and present a live demo of Calabash and Cucumber. He will demonstrate on a hybrid app how you can get started creating your own tests. He will share the joys of the interactive Ruby console - prepare to see the beauty of identifying native and web elements inside hybrid apps, and how to use the console to query your app and help you debug your tests. But no fear, thanks to Cucumber the tests are written as BDD (Given-When-Then), making it easy for all to follow his actions. He will show how you, becoming or being a keen automation engineer, can follow his trails and start your own mobile automation project with Calabash.</p>

<p>There is one consistent thing that drives me forward with my work - the need to help positively change the software testing industry.  Ask me how we can do this, and I’ll say more testers need to up their marketing skills.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will release my years of frustration at the lack of marketing know how that our community holds and why it is so important for us to learn some of these skills.

<p><a href="http://europeantestingconference.eu/slides17/RuCindrea.pdf">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>While working on different mobile testing projects at Altom, we noticed that while developing our automation for each project we kept running into the same problems and challenges and kept solving them over and over again in each case. So we decided to build AltRunner, an automation framework for mobile apps that uses Appium and offers the support we need to focus on developing good automated checks without being distracted by having to worry about device infrastructure, reporting or execution. In this demo session, I’ll show the type of challenges that we encountered over and over throughout the years and the solutions we have found for them as part of AltRunner.</p>

	<h3 class="title"><a href="/2017/speakers#vivien-ibiyemi">Vivien Ibironke Ibiyemi</a> - How I use My Tester&apos;s Toolkit to develop and sustain a tester&apos;s mindset!</h3>
	

	

	


<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">


<p><a href="http://europeantestingconference.eu/slides17/Vivien.pdf">[Slides]</a></p>

<p>Quite a lot of testers often miss out on the mindset that's needed for testing and delivery of quality products. Sometimes it seems that quality consciousness is missing. Little wonder why some testers only find obvious bugs and why quality is far-fetched from the Program under test (PUT), despite the presence of testers on the project. Adding up to this is the overwhelming and unnecessary challenges that await a project where individuals in each role (programmer, project manager, test lead, testers) lack proper understanding and appropriation of the level of “tester’s mindset” that is needed for each role, in order to enhance successful release of quality products.</p>

<p>Reflecting on my daily task and how to keep growing, I discovered that different task, required different lenses, viewed at different angles, with different mindset. Hence to effectively test, I need to tweak my mindset for different task. To achieve this, I need to keep my mindset flexible when I test. To keep my mindset flexible and help me look at things from different angles, I put a label on the mindset approaches that I find useful. Over time, my way of reasoning evolved into a set of tools that I refer to as My Mindset Toolkit.</p>

<p>Using real life test stories, I will present to you examples of mindset tools that I have identified, how I have used them to optimize collaboration in software development teams, become a valuable team member and a skilled tester. I will further propose a model that can help individuals develop their own mindset tools depending on the type of environment and product being developed.</p>

<p>Examples of Identified Mindset Tools are: User, Already Tested, Curiosity, Analytical, Lazy Tester, Communicator, Bug Conviction, Trust, Business and Team leading Mindset Tools.</p>

<p>Key takeaways :</p>
<ul>
  <li>My Mindset Toolkit approach creates awareness about a source of learning and progressive development that we have access to on our daily task as testers, test leads, programmers and project managers but which we have unconsciously neglected.</li>
  <li>Being a breakdown from real life test stories makes the idea of the Mindset tooling unique and applicable to real life test experiences hence a cheap way to develop skilled software development teams.</li>
