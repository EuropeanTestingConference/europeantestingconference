Dr Pamela Gay is an astronomer, writer, and podcaster who leverages software to explore our universe. She runs the CosmoQuest facility, which invites the public to be part of her data reduction routine. She also works to educate anyone who will listen about space science. You can find her podcasting with AstronomyCast, and steaming/tweeting/posting on most new and social media channels as StarStryder. She is a vi-using, LAMP-stack kind of human, and asks that you don’t judge (too much at least - she knows you’re judging).
