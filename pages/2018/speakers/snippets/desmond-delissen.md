Desmond started his career 9 years ago at a big consultancy company.  In 2012 he had the chance to test the mobile app of the biggest retailer of the Netherlands.
Desmond enjoyed this so much that he decided to start working for IceMobile, who is specialised in mobile apps for food retailers, with over 1.5 million active users worldwide and became an expert in testing mobile apps and their backend systems.
