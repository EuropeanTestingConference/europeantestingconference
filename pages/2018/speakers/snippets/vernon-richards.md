Vernon is a software tester with over a decade of experience. He has tested across lifecycle models (Scrum / Kanban / V-Model / Waterfall) and industries as well as technologies, with both co-located and distributed teams. He has a rich set of first-hand knowledge to draw from. In addition to his contributions in projects, we know him well as one face of TestBash, where he has been doing the role of the ceremony master. Vern is awesome, come see yourself.
