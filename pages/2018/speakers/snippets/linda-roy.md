Linda is a technologist, who cares about delivering quality software that gets used by people across the world.

She has had the opportunity to wear many hats which helped in acquiring capabilities of different roles along the way.  She realised that her strength lies in recognising which skills are missing from a development team, and stepping in to close the gap. She values collaboration; she is always asking "why"; and she always seeks a holistic understanding of the whole process required to get the product out there and into active use.

In her spare time, she enjoys going for walks, reading, and playing board games.
