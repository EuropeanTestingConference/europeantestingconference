Come to this session to learn more about what weâ€™re doing when weâ€™re exploratory testing! If you know the theory of exploratory testing but sometimes have trouble articulating what youâ€™re doing â€“ or if youâ€™d like to become more aware of the what and how of your testing, then this is the session for you. By doing live exploratory testing sessions with debriefs, weâ€™ll examine how we approach exploratory testing, how we create and test our models, and how we can communicate what weâ€™re doing to improve our testing itself, our communication about testing, and our sharing of testing knowledge.

The session is aimed at testers, developers, product owners, â€¦ â€“ anyone who ever finds themselves challenging software to a testing duel ðŸ˜Š
