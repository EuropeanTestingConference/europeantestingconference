Main statement: Multiply your knowledge by finding your ‘testing buddy’ anywhere in the world.

The product development and testing world has never experienced such a boom as it has in recent years. Tons of concepts are thrown at you in the digital world via tweets, blog posts, podcasts, and more. Inspiration can be found everywhere you look. But would these insights work in your professional environment as well? Pair up and learn by sharing actual experiences!

Accomplishing something major in your industry or company has always been at the top of your list, but you struggle to find the motivation and drive to do so? Collaborate and inspire each other to achieve your ultimate goals!

Come with us on our journey on how we found each other and what we have learned so far. Pairing up was one of the best experiences we had, so we want to spread the word and encourage you to give it a try. The conference doesn’t have to end on the day you leave - it’s where the fun begins and relationships grow!

Discover how people from different continents, countries, companies, and cultures can work together to achieve one common goal. The answer to gaining the desired knowledge might be sitting with a peer in another part of the world - so break down the barriers of distance, share your ideas and experiences, and find your personal testing buddy!
