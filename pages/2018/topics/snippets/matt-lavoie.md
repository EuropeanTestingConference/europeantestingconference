Software testing is important, that is a given. But are you testing for everything? In the age of the customer it isn’t enough for software to meet functional requirements. If it’s confusing, error prone, difficult to learn or unsatisfying people aren’t going to use it. Even more challenging is the fact that we can’t dependably identify these issues since we understand how the system works.

Usability testing is one of the most effective ways for us to uncover usability issues in the products we work on. In this method we observe as real users interact with software and attempt to complete scenario based tasks. By prompting them with questions and watching them succeed or struggle, we can identify and address the usability problems in our products.

In this session we will observe a usability test first hand, learn the basics of how to conduct one, and how to incorporate it into a testing strategy.
