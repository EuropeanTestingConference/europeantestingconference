In a lean cross-functional team, testers are not just testing, developers are not just developing. They often have to work outside of their core expertise in which they could be less effective.
In this talk, I will share my experience on how I helped upskill the developers to broaden their testing skills by introducing test heuristics. And how by doing so they could take on testing more effectively.
