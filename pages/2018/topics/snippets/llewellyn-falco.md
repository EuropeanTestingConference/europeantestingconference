Many times we test a single scenario, but how do you test thousands or millions of scenarios?
If you can identify some common properties, computers will automate the testing of hundreds of thousands for you. In this talk we will look at the three most common properties.
* Equality - f(x)=g(x)
* Inverse - f-1(f(x))=x
* Sanity - f(x)!=disaster

We will look into how to identify these properties and the basics on how to write these tests.
