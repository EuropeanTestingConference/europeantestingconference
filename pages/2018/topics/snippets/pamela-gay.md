There are still problems beyond the ability of AIs to solve. From mapping craters on rocky worlds, to puzzling out what geographic features are visible in an astronaut images, NASA scientists rely on the volunteers to transform images into machine readable databases. While volunteers are generally well-intentioned, their errors don’t come with friendly flags like 206 or 418 to warn the coder why their responses are out of sorts. Also, some contributors aren’t well intentioned, and may simply write “poop” (or worse) when identifying a volcano. 


Developing tests that will sift the swear words from the science words, and will exclude the cat-on-keyboard-clicks from the volunteer clicks is an organic process that requires a special level of creativity and an ability to embrace the absurd. This talk will give you an insider view on how to employ testing when `<import humans`> is part of your software toolkit.
