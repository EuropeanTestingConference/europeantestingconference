Test Driven Development, TDD, is often talked about, and increasingly adopted. So, what is TDD and if the programmers are doing that, how come there are still bugs?
This talk explores what TDD often is, how it could be, and the benefits it might bring. Join Lynoure to hear about her real life experiences of things going well and not so well in her pursuit of the minimal yet relevant test case in TDD.
