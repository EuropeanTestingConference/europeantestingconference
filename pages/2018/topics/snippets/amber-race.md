Exploratory testing isn't just for websites and mobile applications - the same techniques can help you test at the API level as well! Tools like Postman make it easier than ever to learn about the services that power your application. This session will cover multiple ways in which Postman can aid your API testing, including proxies, mocking, authentication, header management, and much more. Don't limit yourself to the surface of your application - by exploring your APIs, you can increase your overall understanding of your application, find critical issues earlier in the development cycle, and provide a solid base for UI testing. Plus it's fun!
