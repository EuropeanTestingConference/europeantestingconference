Let me take you out of your comfort zone to start finding ways to test the hard stuff.

We often rely on a small set of testing techniques that serve us well in familiar situations. But what do we do when we encounter technologies or requirements that don't fit these techniques? And how do we cope when there are no established testing patterns for these situations?

In this session I want to focus on idiom: I'll use some case studies to draw out some lessons in how to work idiomatically with new systems, and I'll talk about how a broad knowledge of testing idioms can help us find the right technique for testing them.
