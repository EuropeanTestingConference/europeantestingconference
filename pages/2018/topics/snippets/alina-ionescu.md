The goal of this workshop is to familiarize the participants with a series of tools and concepts that are useful in the DevOps world. We will start from zero and in the end we will have a continuous delivery environment set up. Everything is hands-on. As a prerequisite, you need Ubuntu 16.04 running (VM or on your computer). 
In the beginning we will have a setup phase and we will discuss the tools and concepts that we will be working with. Then, we will go to the practical part, where we will configure everything. We will close with conclusions and Q&A. After this workshop, you will have the environment all set up and you can continue exploring after the conference, if you feel like it.
