Behaviour Driven Development is an agile development technique that improves collaboration between technical and non-­technical members of the team, by exploring the problem using examples. These examples then get turned into executable specifications, often called ‘scenarios’. The scenarios should be easy to read by all team members, but writing them expressively is harder than it looks!

In this workshop you will learn how to write expressive BDD scenarios. We’ll start by giving you a very brief introduction to BDD/ATDD. You’ll then be introduced to different writing styles by reviewing pre­prepared scenarios. Finally, you’ll get a chance to write your own scenarios based on examples that we’ll bring along.

We’ll be using Gherkin, the syntax used by Cucumber and SpecFlow ­ but you won’t need a computer. And, you'll leave with a checklist of tips that you can use the next time you sit down to write a scenario.
