"I don’t know.”

These might just be the hardest words to say in any language. We avoid saying them, scared of coming across as doubtful and uncertain. Colleagues expect us to be firm and certain, providing clear answers. Over the past years, I grew increasingly uncomfortable with that. I ended up having a hard time being sure of anything.

"You're rejecting certainty", someone said. "That's skepticism. You're a tester, embrace it!"

That sounded like a good idea, but this left me with a new challenge: how does one embrace skepticism, and how can this help me improve my testing?

I wanted to get to the bottom of this and, for a year, decided to submerge myself in all things skeptic in hope of finding clues to help me with my testing. It was a fascinating journey that led me from philosophy, critical thinking and science to pseudo-science and the paranormal.

This is the story of how I embraced skepticism and how this influenced my testing: by adopting a skeptic manifesto and creating a portfolio of critical thinking heuristics that can be a valuable addition to any tester's toolbox. You will leave armed with tips not only on how to muster up the courage to admit not knowing things, but also on improving your questioning skills and reflexes to reject certainty, empowered by the biggest skeptical force of all: knowing that we’re easy to fool.
