One of the most common reasons why software projects fail are due to misunderstood or poorly clarified requirements. Either because the business are not aware of the business goals they are trying to achieve or they fail to communicate them clearly so the development team understands.

Communication problems are not just a source of annoyance, they can damage a project greatly. When the team don’t have a shared understanding of the business domain or the business goals it can easily lead to gaps, inconsistencies or functionality that works completely different than what was intended. To make software projects succeed we need to solve the communication problem.

In this workshop you will experience how communication problems occur and how you can prevent them. You will learn how BDD (done right) will help you bridge the communication gap, flushing out wrong assumptions before development starts.

You will learn how to use real life examples as the building blocks for both specifications, automated tests and living documentation.

But above all, you will learn how having good conversations is the key to deliver software that matters.
