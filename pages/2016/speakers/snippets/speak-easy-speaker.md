**Abby Bangser** has been working as a Quality Analyst with ThoughtWorks since 2012 with key interests in bridging the gap between the different development team roles and growing the QA community. Experiences include crafting and delivering both internal and external training programs as well as a diverse portfolio of client work. Before coming to ThoughtWorks Abby worked in real estate investments and she continues to stay active in youth lacrosse coaching.

Abby joins the conference on the Speak Easy slot, as a new and coached speaker. She has great stories to share from practical work, and all she really needs from a program like Speak Easy is a little encouragement and support to share what she knows at international conference arenas.
