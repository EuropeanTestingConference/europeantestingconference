Static analysis tools are often used as an enterprise standard because management wants to track metrics, so the team
gets their code in there then forgets about it - out of sight, out of mind. But for someone looking for areas of risk in
a codebase, static analysis tools are a treasure trove of information that is usually difficult to track down manually
or even with test automation. In this session we’ll use the map provided to us by static analysis to find areas of risk
from bugs, duplications, code coverage (or lack thereof), and complexity. We can further analyze these hazards to get a
clearer picture of the actual risks, or take immediate action to reduce that risk by killing them off. And if you’re not
using static analysis tools just yet, you’ll learn about just how invaluable they are to the entire team, not just
management!
