So you need to test micro-services, and you’ve been hearing Consumer Driven Contract Testing (CDCT) with Pact is the cool
new thing on the block? It seems like it perfectly fits what you need. You might even go ahead and give it ago, run a
proof of concept yourself or have a few developers/testers try it. And if this is gonna work, the ideal is that all your
teams use it - otherwise you will have blind spots in your testing approach. But how do you go from a proof of concept
to several teams adopting it? How do you make sure everyone is doing the right things and has the proper understanding
of Pact? How do you avoid mistakes by people who didn’t take the proper time to understand this tool? How do you get
through Pact’s learning curve and make sure you are not misunderstanding it yourself?

In this workshop, we are going to try to work as a company with teams looking to adopt CDCT, with a focus on avoiding some pitfalls that might cost you time and money. 

What can you look to gain from this workshop?

A deeper understanding of Contract Testing through the use of Pact; 

Knowledge on important concepts like versioning, tagging and naming conventions; 

Insight on Pact’s learning curve, and some mistakes people tend to make; 

An idea on how the Pact workflow works from a simulated hands-on situation.

You can get more out of this workshop if you already have some beginner/intermediate knowledge of Pact. However, we will
briefly go through some basics, and at the very least you can pick up some important notes and tips along the way. So,
all are welcome!
