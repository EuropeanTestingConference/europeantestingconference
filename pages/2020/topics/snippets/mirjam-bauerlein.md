Before I started my career in software development, I worked for many years as a dog trainer. The experiences I made in this time are the reason why I immediately fell in love with testing. So, let’s talk about TDD! TDD stand for Test-driven development and it’s not only a technique to write tests but also a design process in software development. I want to give you a new perspective on this process and explain how to TDD with the help of comparing it to how to train a dog. TDD has much in common with dogtraining, so at the end of my talk you should be able to write a piece of c test driven code, and also teach a dog a little trick - well, the last thing at least theoretically.
