First, you need to access a web page. You then need to read some information from the web page. And then you need that
information in tests, in order to compare the actual information from the page to the expected one.

Data read from the pages can be a real puzzle and a mess, if it is not properly organized. For example, what if you need
to read the ingredients for a list of cakes? Or the price of coffee based beverages? How do you organize data read from
ordered lists or tables, just to name a few? How do you extract the relevant information from the page and where do you
store it? I will demonstrate the answer to all these questions on real examples with real code, using awesome Java
concepts like Lists, HashMaps or Strings.
