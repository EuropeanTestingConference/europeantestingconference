Have you ever looked at a failing automated test and asked yourself... should we just delete it? I've asked myself this
question numerous times; I've trained myself to do so, because I understand its importance. However, I'm often left
baffled by colleagues and other testers who reject the idea of deleting a test. Why do they find it such a scary
concept? So the result is that we continuously look and review the same tests, not knowing if they’re mitigating any
risks, or worse, not knowing what they are testing anymore. But if you're like me, you've probably looked at some
failing tests before that left you thinking "why does this even exist?!". That trigger is one you shouldn't ignore.

In this talk, I'm going to share my experiences of listening to this trigger, but more importantly, I'll explain
the actions I take. You'll learn how to analyze the full lifecycle of an automated test to truly understand its value.
We'll talk about the total cost of ownership of a test, and how it is a key analysis factor when attempting to reduce
feedback loops. I’ll bring some stories from the company I work for to support this. After all, we’ve gone from
automated regression environments running thousands of tests overnight to a CI/CD reality. I love my delete key, I hope
to share the love!
