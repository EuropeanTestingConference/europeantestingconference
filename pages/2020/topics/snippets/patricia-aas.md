How can you squeeze Security into DevOps? Security is often an understaffed function, so how can you leverage what you have in DevOps to improve your security posture?

Often the culture clash between Security and Development is even more prominent than between Development and Operations. Understanding the differences in how these functions work, and leveraging their similarities, will reveal processes already in place that can be used to improve security. This fine tuning of tools and processes can give you DevSecOps on a shoestring.
