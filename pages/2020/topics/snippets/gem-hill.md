How do you figure out where and how to add value once you stop doing hands on testing day to day?
In 2018 I was promoted to Senior tester when I moved to a new department. This meant I was on two teams, both with full time testers, so there wasn't a lot of work for me to test. Suddenly I had to balance two teams, but not day to day testing, and no team lead responsibilities.

I wanted to make sure I was adding value to these teams and the testers on them without taking work away from them or getting in the way. I also wanted to make sure I knew the value I was adding - without knowing the value I bring, I had no idea what I needed to strengthen in or what skills to add to my toolbox.
But I'd never had a job that was focused solely on the non-technical skills of testing before! Suddenly my priorities were being visible, driving communication and strategy: all things that have few 'solid' goals! 

This talk will cover what I've learned in the past year and a half of this role, some successes, some failures, and some
tools I discovered to help me.
