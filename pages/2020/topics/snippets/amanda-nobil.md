It happens. You've seen it in the news. You've seen it on social media. You've most certainly seen it on at *least* one
of the project teams you've worked on over the course of your career, no matter how long you've been working in software
development....

A bug escapes to Production.

Maybe it's small and the damage can be mitigated or reversed quickly. Maybe it's not so small, and it sends your team, and maybe even your whole organization, into a frenzy.

This is our nightmare scenario. We feel inadequate. We feel it is our fault for missing something so "obvious"...but was
it really? And who really **was** to blame anyway? Whose head belongs on the proverbial chopping block?

In this talk, I will answer all of these questions and provide a framework for preventing these incidents from happening again.
