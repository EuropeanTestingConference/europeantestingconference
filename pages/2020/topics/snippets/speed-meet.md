This is a session to get everyone introduced to at least 10 new people.
You will draw a personal mind-map (with nodes: personal, work, accomplishments).
Every 5 minutes you will exchange mind-maps with a new person, and each of you will ask the others about the items you are interested in.
Afterwards, the conference will be an even friendlier place.
