Did you ever struggle consuming an API that kept on changing? Did you provide an API that you were unsure how people will use it? 
In such a scenario, an iterative and cooperative way of working that focuses on consumer driven contract testing can reduce your pain. In other words, an experience with "Consumer collaboration over contract negotiation".

This talk aims to practically illustrate consumer driven testing using Pact. We will cover when this technique is appropriate and how to organise, define and evolve APIs while keeping in mind. The session will involve a mixture of presentation and live coding to illustrate on how this works in practice.
