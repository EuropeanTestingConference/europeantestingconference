Do you ever have this experience: Your team discusses a story in the planning meeting, codes and tests using good practices, delivers it to the product owner or customer - who then rejects it because it wasn't what they wanted. We see this all too frequently, even on experienced agile teams. It leads to long cycle times, high rejection rates, wasted time and general frustration.
We don't want to get stuck in "analysis paralysis", but we do need to make sure that everyone on the cross-functional product team shares the same understanding of each story they need to deliver before they begin testing and coding. Teams also need to remember there are many different quality attributes that may be critical to a product’s success.

In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn techniques such as the 7 dimensions of quality to help you apply your testing mindset to elicit examples and business rules from stakeholders. You’ll practice turning those into test scenarios that guide development of the right things, so that your team can deliver value to the business frequently and predictably. 

**Learning takeaways:**

•	Ways to explore requirements and do deliberate discovery, in a timely manner, to uncover missing, conflicting, erroneous and unnecessary requirements.

•	Techniques from agile business analysis and agile testing models that help teams scope each feature and deliver acceptable value to the business, considering all relevant quality attributes.

•	How to use your testing mindset and conversation frameworks to help your whole team build shared understanding for each feature and story, shortening cycle time and reducing rejections.
