We have heard a lot about mob programming and mob testing, but what if you actually start doing it? And stick with it, even if the first sessions aren’t that great? Well, that’s what we did! We’ll tell stories of our weekly mob testing sessions, what issues we uncovered (spoiler: not many), what we learned (spoiler: lots) and how we got better at it over time.

We started mob testing once a week this past February: four testers from four different teams and one facilitator. The biggest hurdle we faced was learning how to collaborate as a mob. We knew we were getting somewhere when a few people went “Ooh!” simultaneously. We were surprised by how many different things we learned: about each other’s products, operating systems, tools, languages, and keyboard shortcuts. To be honest, we haven’t gotten to a point where we find a lot of bugs yet. And we don’t know that we ever will. 

However, we have been learning so many useful things that we have no plans to stop mob testing anytime soon. The lessons we learned are worth more than any bugs we could find. By sticking with mob testing, we have built good habits that have made us better collaborators.
