Do you do these things with your team members?

•	Challenge them to solve their own problems

•	Motivate them with frequent feedback

•	Empower them to make their own mistakes

Leaders often base their daily interactions with team members on similar premises. But do they always work? 
Good leaders know that no leadership practice is universally applicable. We don’t apply “standard” practices blindly.
Instead, we prefer to evaluate any practice for fit with a given team member in a particular circumstance. Perhaps we
also develop and selectively apply our own practices. This is using practices heuristically—as imperfect models or rules
of thumb that we can call on when they seem appropriate and useful.
By consciously adopting heuristic methods, we can help grow our practice of leadership from black art to something more
closely resembling science. We can expand our capabilities.

In this interactive workshop, participants will work in teams to share or develop heuristics for leadership, and then apply their own experiences to evaluate them critically. 
We’ll have fun exploring the practices of test leadership and developing a set of positive heuristics that can help us
all become more effective leaders in our daily work.

This workshop is for testers, test managers, test leads — anyone who is or wants to become a test leader.
