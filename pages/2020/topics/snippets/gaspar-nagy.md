A typical software delivery process is full of accidental domain discovery -- even if the project follows agile practices. No matter how good specification are that you receive or how good your Product Owner is in explaining the User Story requirements; whenever you as a developer or a tester start working on the solution for real, new questions will arise. You need to go back to the Product Owner or try to answer them yourself based on assumptions. Accidental discovery.

Regardless of which agile software methodology you use, there is a time when you show the created solution to the business representatives to get feedback (like in Sprint Review meeting in Scrum). And the feedback is very rarely "Ship it!", but more often asking for changes or clarifying misunderstandings. Accidental discovery again!

Accidental discovery causes longer story implementation cycles (Have you heard about "done done"?) and unnecessary rework. Waste.

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is an approach that encourages deliberate discovery: trying to answer those questions that would otherwise pop up during the implementation and getting feedback about the solution even before putting down a single line of code. How is this possible? BDD uses a combination of example-based specification and requirement workshop facilitation to achieve deliberate discovery.

In this workshop, you will not only hear about deliberate discovery, specification by example, BDD and example mapping, but you will also have a chance to practice it.
