The programmer holds the power in the team. The ux designer, the product owner, the manager, the tester, the agile coach
and others can try their best to influence outcomes but it doesn’t matter if the programmer is not on board. Only the
programmer decides which if-statements get written and how long it will take. What does this mean for the other team
members? How can you impact quality if you’re not the one making the ultimate decision?
