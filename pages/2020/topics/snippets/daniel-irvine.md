If developers are always striving to do their best work, then why is software so full of bugs?

This talk is a light-hearted look at the all-too common missteps that we all make when building software.

Developers often have strongly-held beliefs about what makes “good” software. These beliefs come from dogma passed down through generations rather than from empirical evidence. I’ll show how we can help developers challenge the status quo and start experimenting with new approaches.
