Being a tester is a lifetime journey, but working as a software tester is just temporary. I transitioned to a new Product Owner role, and found some of the skills I had as a tester to be far more useful than I expected. I also found out about a bunch of skills that I now wanted to learn.
My talk is around these skills, the ones I had, and the ones I'm still missing.
