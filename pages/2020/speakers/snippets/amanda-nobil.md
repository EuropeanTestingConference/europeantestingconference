Amanda Nobil is a Sr. Staff Test Engineer at Medidata Solutions, Inc. She started out in public policy and administration as well as law and legal studies, but began what she thought would be a "rebound relationship" with testing after moving to the San Francisco Bay Area. Many years later, she finds herself instead as part of a loving, if cheeky, union with code based on mutual respect and admiration.

Amanda often finds herself in a number of roles within a role: Investigator, Doctor, and Psychologist to name the most prominent few. However, she is of the opinion that such is testing and such is life.

When not uttering either the words, "Wait, but why?" or "Let's explore that *feature/thought/statement/etc.* a little
more," you can find her observing (lurking?) on Twitter or thinking a lot about testing, software, and her place in that
realm.
