Hi! I'm Crystal and I have become very passionate about topics that are still considered more or less taboo like expressing our authentic selves, embracing our fears and shortcomings, and enjoying our share of the pie to the fullest.
I started my career as a software developer and I am now an Emotional Skills Coach which essentially means, becoming a life-long student of life.
