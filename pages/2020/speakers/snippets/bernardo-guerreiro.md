Bernardo Guerreiro, from Portugal and living in London, is a Software Engineer with a focus on Release and Testing. He
has a wide range of experiences, ranging from device automation to testing of distributed systems, both from a frontend
and backend perspective. In particular, he has solid hands-on experience of implementing Contract Testing at a large
scale on a micro-services architecture. Recently he has been very interested in how DevOps can complement the role of
Quality Assurance in an organisation, and in trying to solve company-wide problems by being involved in architecting and
building infrastructure and tooling to support multiple teams. He currently works for Auth0, an industry leading identity as a service provider.

On a personal note, he likes to spend his spare time with his partner and friends, is an avid traveller, and now enjoys
card games as a hobby (having formerly played some of them on a professional level).
