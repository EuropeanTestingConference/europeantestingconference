I am Mirjam and I started programming at the age of eleven on a Schneider CPC 464 in Locomotive BASIC. While programming has been a hobby ever since, my career didn't start in that field at all. I was an accountant, management assistant and office administrator. Later I started to work as a dogtrainer with main focus on behavioral issues. After many years working with people and their dogs I changed my career for the second time and became a frontend developer.
