Hi, I’m Maaike. Like many other people in testing, I accidentally became a tester. I got an opportunity to test for the business in the “User Acceptance Phase” and found out that I love asking “why” and trying to find out how systems work. This was 10 years ago, but it feels like a lifetime ago!

In these 10 years, I’ve seen testing and the role of the tester change. A lot. I had to change as well. But some things remain the same: my love for asking questions and finding out how systems work.

In the testing community, I’m known for my work in the exploratory testing and critical thinking domain. It’s my mission to make more people aware how our work is shaped by our own cognitive biases and (lack of) critical thinking. I try to fill in the role as tester as broad as possible because I don’t like to be put in a box. I’m a tester, but I can do so much more than that.
