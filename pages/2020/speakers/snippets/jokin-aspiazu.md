Jokin as been a Software Tester since 2008, he had moved from Waterfall to Agile, from Test cases to Exploratory testing, from Excel to Rapid Software Testing. He has learnt from James Bach & Michael Bolton, from Huib choots & Richard Bradshaw, from Lisa Crispin & Fiona Charles, from Pekka Marjamäki & Martin Hynie … and one night he invited Pradeep Soundararajan to dinner, so he knows about the secret sauce of testing.
In this year 2019 he has changed role, and now performs as Product Owner in Flywire, using his old tester skills and learning the Product Owning thing.
