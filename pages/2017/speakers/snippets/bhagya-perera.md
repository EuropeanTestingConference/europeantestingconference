**Bhagya Perera** is a software testing enthusiast who is originally from Sri Lanka and currently lives and works in England for Reed Business Information (RBI), a part of Reed Elsevier. She has a lot of experience working as an offshore team member and knows how much the experience can differ when it comes to on-site teams. Bhagya also co-hosts the RBI Global QA-chapter to help herself and other testers share experiences. In addition, she has strong interests in leadership, effective communication and mentoring that broadens her knowledge. Also, be advised... whenever you want her to listen to you, be sure to use the imperial march music. It always works! You can reach her at @bhagyagdm.
