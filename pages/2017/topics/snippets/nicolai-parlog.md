Java&apos;s most ubiquitous library is getting an update! This talk will...

  * show you how to write tests with JUnit 5
  * walk you through the changes compared to JUnit 4
  * expand on dynamic tests or the extension model (your choice)
  * quickly present the new architecture
  * discuss compatibility with previous JUnit versions, IDEs, and other
testing tools

Be careful, though: You might end up with an urge to start using it
right away.
