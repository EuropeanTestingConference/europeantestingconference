Java's most ubiquitous library is getting an update! And this is the time to see what's new and weigh in on its course.

This talk will...

 * show you how to write tests with JUnit 5

 * walk you through the changes compared to JUnit 4

 * expand on dynamic tests and the extension model

 * present the new architecture

 * discuss compatibility with previous JUnit versions, IDEs, and other testing tools

Be careful, though: You might end up with an urge to start using it right away.
