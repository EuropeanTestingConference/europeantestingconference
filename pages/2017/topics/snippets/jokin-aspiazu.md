Flywire has users (Students) and clients (Schools). Schools have deadlines for making the payments, and guess what... (many) Students choose to pay the very last day. This is something Jokin and the dev team learnt in their 5 years experience.

In this talk I will explain how we managed to test our system and be ready for the biggest deadline we ever had. How involved the tester has been, and what kind of initiatives we tried out, explaining both what worked and what didn't.

Be my guest, if you think you can do way more as a software tester than just wait for features to get tested, and let me tell you how it went for me.
