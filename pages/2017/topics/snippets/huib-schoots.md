Much has been said and written about exploratory testing. Unfortunately, it appears that exploratory testing is still often misunderstood. Some claim that exploratory testing is unstructured and ad hoc. Just playing or cruising through the software clicking stuff without a plan. I think that is because it might look that way. Excellent testing done by a real professional looks easy from the outside. But what is really going on?

In this demo talk I will test software and while doing that, I will explain what I am doing and why. I will also give insight in the techniques, skills and tactics that are being used. There is a lot going on when we test and by narrating and framing what is going on, we create understanding. By knowing what skills and tactics we use, it helps us focus on the right things and it enables learning them. The audience will be engaged in this demo by observing and trying to figure out what is really going on on stage.
