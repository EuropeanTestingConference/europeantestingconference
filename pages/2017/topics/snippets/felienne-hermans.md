Spreadsheets are used extensively in businesses across all domains.

However, as opposed to software, spreadsheets are not regularly checked, audited or tested, or refactored and maintained in a structured fashion. In this session, Felienne will explain how spreadsheet users test in practice, and which concepts of testing can and should be applied to spreadsheets.
