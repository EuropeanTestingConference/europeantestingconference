Unit testing is as important in the JavaScript world as anywhere else and the community has created a great ecosystem over the last years. However, it also lacks the standard library people are used to from other languages, making it harder to get started both for programming beginners as well as people switching from other ecosystems. For this workshop we'll skip this tedious part, work with a prepared toolchain and jump straight into practicing testing skills on a JS kata. We'll work in multiple sessions with changing pairs so we can adapt to the participants skill levels during the workshop, so the session should be valuable both for people that write code in JS and want to get started with writing tests as well as advanced programmers that are already driving all their JS code test-first.
