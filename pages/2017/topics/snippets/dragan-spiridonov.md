Testing is about learning. We need to learn the systems, applications, and features we test. We need to learn the ways we do testing and how to use tools to help us while doing testing. Our ability to learn fast and work on partial information is often what helps us succeed as testers. We have a lot to learn from the wider knowledge base of learning that teachers apply when teaching students.

In this talk, we look at three specific techniques that can help you learn faster while solving some of the everyday testing problems. The techniques are based on my experience as a teacher and a trainer and are shared with the practical application of my work as a tester. You’ll learn about Focused and Diffused mode, Pomodoro technique, and Mindmaps, and get practical advice on how these can help you in your work as a tester. These techniques already have helped testers and developers at my work and in my local community to take control of their learning and learn better and faster about testing, development, or any other topic of interest.

The three techniques will get you to a good start on your lifelong learning and help you advance faster in your career. Don’t take learning for granted, pay attention and work on improving on it to unlock your hidden potential and help yourself in both professional and personal development.

There’s a lot to learn and our skills of learning have never been as important as they are now. Join me to learn how to learn faster!
