<p><i> This training is half-a-day and paired with the Usability training under the theme of the core parafunctional quality aspects</i></p>
<p>We know that application security is important. We have to protect our customers’ data and our employers’ data while keeping our systems up and running. But do we have the skills and knowledge to meet that challenge?</p>
<p>During this training, we will begin to explore some of the concepts, skills, and techniques of security testing by working with a vulnerable web application. Through practical activities and hands-on learning, we will discover the key security issues that affect web applications today.</p>
<p>Testers will learn skills to identify software vulnerabilities and understand common threats and risks that occur in web-applications. We will also examine some of the tools and utilities that can enhance and extend security testing efforts. Let’s look at the essential steps to build and execute your own security testing strategies. Let’s examine how learning and mentoring can aid in the development of strategies.  You can and should build up your own skills with integrated security testing. This will ensure ongoing relevance of your role in a security context, and the success of your organisations.</p>
<p>Building upon personal experience of integrating security testing into an existing organisation, incorporating DevOps, continuous delivery and integration, this training will highlight and discuss the reflections of learning from hackers, recent breaches and the socio-economic, political and technical impact upon software development organisations.</p>
<p>Attendees will take away a set of advice and techniques to incorporate and enable security testing into their day to day work, answering some of the questions that may arise around scope, skills, tools, models and learning.</p>
<p><strong>Technical requirements:</strong></p>
<p>This is a practical training, so all attendees will require a laptop, and the ability to install and run the application under test, as well as some open source tools that will be useful during the session.  Installation instructions and a tool list will be sent before the training, and pre-installation is highly recommended for a smooth training experience.</p>
<p>Prior experience in security testing web applications is not necessary; however, attendees will need to be comfortable testing web applications and using modern web-browsers (i.e. Firefox, Chrome, Safari).</p>

<p>A leader sets an example and inspires others to follow and then to lead in their turn. You don’t have to be a manager to be a leader—but if you’re not also a leader, you can’t be a good manager.</p>

<p>In this interactive workshop, we’ll examine the skills and personal qualities essential for exceptional test leadership. You’ll have an opportunity to practice solving leadership problems, to assess your leadership aspirations and potential, and see how you can become the leader you want to be and bring benefits to all the projects you work on.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of the workshop:</strong>
Creating a safe space to try out communication techniques
Give the time and opportunity to practice</p>
<p><strong>Audience:</strong>
Anyone, who has an interest in better communication</p>
<p><strong>Learning goals:</strong>
How to listen to people so they feel genuinely understood
How to give and receive feedback</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
People in the software industry are trained in programming, testing, design, documentation, and requirement management. That makes our work very much based on blacks and whites: does it compile? Will the test pass? Does it fulfill the requirements? Bits and bytes, 0s and 1s, verified or not - all black and white.</p>
<p>Communication, on the other hand, is everything in between.
We are not trained to be effective in our communication and yet much of our work requires collaboration with others.</p>
<p>In this workshop we want to give you a space where you can learn effective communication techniques, and have the time to practice these.
Here you will learn to listen, not to respond, but to hear what is actually being said. We will provide you with tools to give and receive feedback. We will help you express what you want and what you need.</p>
<p>We want to inspire you to have the courage to be yourself as you communicate in an effective manner.</p>
<p><strong>Hosts:</strong>
Aki Salmi &amp; Gitte Klitgaard. Both are quite active in the software community, speaking at and organising (un)conferences. Their focus is on software craftsmanship and agile respectively, and they have a common interest in the people aspects: communication, listening and creating a safe space for people to be themselves.
They believe in and help teams to find joy and purpose at work.</p>

<p>Although a great deal of the enthusiasm for agile development initially grew from software developers, much of the current focus in agile circles has moved to organisational aspects, product management and soft skills. Craftsmanship has long been a quality and a metaphor applied to software development, but more recently software craftsmanship has emerged as a more explicit movement and branding focused on reclaiming and re-emphasising the importance of the detail, of how to code and how to do it well.</p>
<p>This training explores the key elements of software craftsmanship, from what constitutes good code and unit tests to deliberate practice and reflection.</p>
<p>There will be slides, there will be discussion, there will be code — and there will be fun! The hands-on sessions will follow a coding dojo format with a focus on pair programming and TDD. No special software is needed, just Wi-Fi access, as we will be using the online cyber-dojo environment.</p>

<div class="topic-info hidden-xs">
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Behaviour-Driven Development is a practice in which we talk through different examples (scenarios) of how a system might work, from the perspective of its many users. In this unique tutorial we mix BDD with Cynefin, the sensemaking framework that helps makes sense of the world around you and the problems you encounter depending on their predictability.</p>
<p>The course provides thinking and conversational tools to enable teams, product owners and managers to address risk early, develop a deep understanding of requirements at different scales, shorten the time needed to reach that understanding, produce high-quality, innovative solutions, and create human-readable, relevant and memorable tests as a by-product… and it’s not just applicable to software!</p>
<p>For each outcome, attendees will demonstrate the skill during interactive exercises in the course.</p>
<p><strong>BDD</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain BDD and its practices</li>
  <li>Create well-formed scenarios which are relevant to your own domain</li>
  <li>Use conversational patterns to draw out new scenarios and explore scope</li>
  <li>Discuss how best to engage Developers, Testers and Analysts or Business Experts in conversations</li>
  <li>Identify and design mechanisms for quick feedback using single scenarios</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cynefin</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain the Cynefin model and how it relates to BDD and Specification by Example</li>
  <li>Estimate the level of complexity in different requirements phrased at different scales</li>
  <li>Predict when an unelaborated requirement is likely to cause conflict or excessive discussion</li>
  <li>Discuss shortcuts to apply to well-understood requirements to reduce analysis and planning time</li>
  <li>Differentiate between well-understood, domain-specific, and innovative / uncertain aspects of work through using scenarios in conversations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Capability Red</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify core and incidental stakeholders for a project</li>
  <li>Generate a map of desired capabilities from lower-level stories and scenarios</li>
  <li>Identify risk and uncertainty in capability maps</li>
  <li>Discuss prioritization of long-term plans accordingly</li>
  <li>Decide whether to engage stakeholders before or only after implementation (educators vs. gatekeepers / checklist)</li>
  <li>Phrase capability-level problems  in problem-space language, without diving into solution-focused features</li>
  <li>Identify continuous capabilities to which BDD can be applied using monitoring (non-functionals and other non-discrete requirements)</li>
  <li>Discuss monitoring mechanisms, including manual processes and compliance / governance where applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that automation of scenarios will be mentioned in this course, but is out of scope; this course focuses on the conversational and analytical aspects of BDD.</p>

<p>“All the brilliant people, working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.“ - that is Mob Programming. When the activity we mob on is exploratory testing or test automation, or the viewpoint to being a programming mob is that of a tester, we call it Mob Testing. Mob testing - a group testing activity utilizing one computer - voices out the tacit knowledge in the group of individuals on shared tasks. Facilitated by an expert, it makes a great mechanism for building habits and transferring skills over passing knowledge.</p>
<p>In this course, we amp up our testing skills by learning from one another, and learn in a mob, getting the best knowledge out of the team into the task at hand. With mob testing, we get a glimpse into the head of the testers while they test because “for an idea to go from your head to the computer, it must go through someone else’s hands”. This is a specific communication style called Strong-style pairing, and it connects the group of brilliant minds in the mob in a shared experience.</p>
<p>We will work on different types of activities as a group: from analyzing a user interface to analyzing an individual feature; from having ready code to creating some with test-driven development; and from focusing on testing to focusing on teamwork dynamics.</p>

<p><i> This training is half-a-day and paired with the Security training under the theme of the core parafunctional quality aspects</i></p>
<p>Every piece of software with an interface has one thing in common, people. And where people are involved there will always be hidden gaps in usability we are blind to. One of the most effective ways to uncover these issues is through usability testing.</p>
<p>Anyone can facilitate a usability test, but there are some important techniques you must learn to ensure you receive unbiased results. In this hands on training we will practice planning and conducting usability tests. During our time together we will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Craft scenarios and tasks that don’t lead users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conduct usability tests</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn when and how to dig in deeper with candidates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discover why it’s important to let a user struggle during the session</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn methods to gather valuable feedback from teammates who are observing</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This training will focus on applied practice, and we will learn these things by doing them. Attendees are encouraged to bring a product they would like to test to the workshop.</p>
