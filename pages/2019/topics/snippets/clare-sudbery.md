Do you code on your own? Do you use TDD? Do you write unit tests? Do you understand exactly what the benefits of TDD and unit testing are?

Recently, Sal Freudenberg and I have been remote-pairing on an iOS puzzle app. The reason I asked Sal to join me is that my testing strategy was getting more and more lax, and the quality of the code was suffering.

I love playing this app, which makes me not only software engineer but also end user, product owner, business stakeholder, and everything else. As a user I wanted new features and I wanted them NOW. I didnâ€™t care about the tests - I just wanted a better game! But the increasing lack of tests made the code harder and harder to extend.

I stopped testing for bad reasons, but then started again for good ones. This experience allowed me to demonstrate in practice the impact it can have on your code base when you stop testing.

This talk, based on simple practical examples, will explain exactly why unit tests, a TDD approach and pairing make all the difference to your code.
