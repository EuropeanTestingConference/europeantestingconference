The best interface is told to be the one that is seamless to interact with, and a new wave of interfaces based on text, voice or gestures is emerging based on this motto.

At the same time, these interfaces make use of advanced algorithms, ranging from pattern and expression matching engines to natural language processing and AI algorithms.

Given these starting conditions, testing conversational interfaces can raise challenges, from both the novelty as well as from the complexity point of view.

My session covers the most important aspects of testing such interfaces, sharing experience on what to do and what to look for, highlighting the importance modelling  intents and transitions in the state-machine model

Key learnings:
- What is a conversational interface?
- How can I build my testing approach for such an interface?
- What from my current toolset can I use for this new context?
