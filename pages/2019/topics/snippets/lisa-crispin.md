Software teams often don’t control all the pieces and parts of their development or delivery environments.
Especially in large organizations, multiple teams, each with different focuses and goals, are needed to deploy new and updated features.
Seemingly unimportant details have potential to derail  a project or a design, before you’ve had time to adjust.
How can you and your team become aware of external impacts, and find ways to get value out to customers?
In this workshop, Melissa Eaden and Lisa Crispin will shine a light on organizations.
They’ll help participants learn to use dependency mapping to identify all the other people, resources, external organizations and more that can impact a software delivery team.

Goals:

* Learn different kinds of dependency mapping and the visual and informational value they provide

* Learn interview techniques to  you can use to  collect data about your application’s dependencies, and how to turn that into visual maps to help your team manage those dependencies.

* Practice interviewing and creating maps to help identify relationships you need to build with other parts of your organization.
