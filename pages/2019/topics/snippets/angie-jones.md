*Feature:* As an advertiser on a given social media platform, I want to target the types of users that my ad will be shown to.

Seems easy enough. Immediate tests that come to mind are around the advertiser being able to specify the types of users that should be targeted while creating the ad. Sure, this should certainly be tested and won’t be too difficult to validate. However, the challenge comes in when attempting to validate that users who meet such criteria are the only ones being served.

In this talk, Angie will share her story of trying to automate test scenarios that were essentially untestable due to various limitations and restrictions. Warning: this story is not filled with warm fuzzies and rainbows. No, it’s filled with challenge after challenge. Angie will discuss the technical challenges, and how coming up with solutions to these were still not enough. She’ll share the details of her harsh realization that the power to test the untestable was not in her hands alone, and that a “whole team” approach was the only way to truly be successful.

Slides: to be added soon...
