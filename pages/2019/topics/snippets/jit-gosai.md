There is a lot of thinking that test automation will help you release faster and with better quality because you can catch bugs quicker than any manual processes.

It's almost as if it's a cure to our problems within software development.
But what if we could take a more preventative approach to these ailments and stop the bugs from ever developing in the first place?

For our teams it's looking at our development practices as a lifestyle. To be reviewed regularly, with plenty of rest and regular check ups to make sure we're on the right path.

This talk is split into two parts with the first detailing our journey with test automation and the second half about what new things we have introduced to start heading towards a more productive and healthier (development) lifestyle.

*Searching for a cure to our problems:* From weeks of manual testing and only releasing a handful of times per year. To using frameworks such as BDD to understand what it is we’re trying to build and then automate our acceptance testing. I’ll talk about how we went about applying BDD principles and what we really got out of it.

*Taking a preventative approach:* I’ll cover some of the custom software metrics we employed to understand how we are building our systems and the behaviours this influenced. Our use of pair-programming to speed up code reviews, addressing our technical debt weekly and our renewed focus on code level testing to build testability into our systems.
