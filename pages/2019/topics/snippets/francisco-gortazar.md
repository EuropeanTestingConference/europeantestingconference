Since many organizations are moving their applications to the cloud, investing in some kind of service distribution or even applying a microservice approach,
gathering relevant information about the system behaviour is becoming more and more critical.
Usually, proper services are available in our production systems to get insight as to what is happening with our production systems.
However, this information might be relevant as well at our testing environments. How can we bring the degree of detail available sometimes only at production to our QA environments?
This talk will discuss tools and practices that we can leverage to acquire relevant information from the product and its tests,
and how this information can be put together to facilitate a joint work between testers and developers not just finding bugs, but also finding the root-cause of those bugs,
making everyone's work more effective.
