After a 10+ year break from developing I dipped a toe back into the coding world through a series of two-day stops on a “coding tour". Before I knew it everything was turned up to 11 and I had become a permanent member of a team who Remote Mob Program every day.

How did it feel to return?
How does remote mobbing work?
Aren’t you autistic - how on earth did you cope with mobbing?

Learn the answers to these questions and more, along with some hints and tips for learning, mobbing, working remotely and tuning for inclusivity.

Slides: to be added soon...
