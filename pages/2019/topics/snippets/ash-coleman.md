What builds and maintains our culture? Everyday we identify ourselves in groups that
categorize us based on practices, rather than shared principles. In the workplace, company
values define culture that is deeply rooted in hiring practices, incentive programs, and
management. Although a common approach, this is not the way diverse and inclusive culture
evolves. There is a loud call and demand for diversity today. So what do we do?

This is not a light topic. Diversity is often met with fear, frustration, defensiveness, and overall
exhaustion. So, let’s take a moment to listen. When you do, you will be provided an opportunity
to get answers that you may find incredibly difficult to ask.

Through this talk, Ash will take you on a journey. She will help you understand the impact of
spaces lacking diversity by sharing accounts of the structural barriers she faced when moving to
infiltrate the tech space. She will recall her struggles with assuming “like-mindedness” in order
to gain access to the opportunities in tech, as well as highlight what it means to feel included as
an “minority”. Most importantly, she will share stories of the residual climb she encounters to
be seen as a tech professional in today’s tech space.

“I am not a cultural fit. And likely never will be.” Ash will awaken you to the complexity around
culture and opportunities within tech, from the perspective of a Black Woman. And in
exchange, you will have the floor to ask the more difficult questions we are all bushing up
against. Am I making an impact on either side of this problem? What can I do to contribute?
Why should I care about diversity? In this talk you will be challenged to take a hard look at your
own participation in these communities and gain understanding of how to recognize issues and
support solutions.
