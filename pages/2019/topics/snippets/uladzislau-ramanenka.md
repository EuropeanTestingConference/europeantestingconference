Have you heard about TestSphere? It’s a deck of cards designed to get you thinking and talking about testing. I was inspired by them and wanted to use them more in my everyday work.
So I decided to start a “30-day TestSphere challenge”: for each of my testing tasks, I randomly pick up a card and try to apply the idea from it within my testing activities.
I'd like to be honest and in the talk I will present which ideas worked and which didn't. I hope that my example will inspire the others to think wider, be more creative and effective in testing.
