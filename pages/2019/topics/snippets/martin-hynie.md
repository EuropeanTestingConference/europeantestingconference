"SHIFT LEFT!"
"CI!"
"FAIL FAST!"
"TESTING IS A CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISE THAT HELPS US BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM AND THE IMPLICATIONS.... sigh..."

Let's be honest, truly transformational ideas are rarely easy to get started, but some ideas are certainly stickier than others. We have seen some excellent changes happen in our industry that have really advanced our ability to build software faster... but where are the sticky changes that really focus on quality and testing? We have some of the worlds great thinkers writing about this. The world demands quality... but it still feels like a  dogfight every time. 

Inevitably, it becomes a prolonged (and ongoing) discussion point rather than a movement. Is there any way we can take advantage of the power of momentum? Is it all about clever terms and catchy phrases? Or is there more to marketing and branding that we just are not taking into consideration?

Is there a science to branding? Short answer... yes. And we really need to start to pay attention.

In this workshop, we will explore what the world of branding and marketing can teach the testing community. Areas of exploration include:
- The science of measuring market energy and disposition
- Performance as authenticity
- Incremental idea injection and experimentation
- Researching market categorization
- What the world of online dating can teach us (no really... this is super important)

Bring your challenges. Bring the testing transformations you want to see happen at your workplace. Bring your frustrations, your hopes and your concerns. Together, let's explore what the world of branding might share with us, and tap into some of the worlds most effective methods for connecting great ideas with real energy for change.
