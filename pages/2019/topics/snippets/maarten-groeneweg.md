Microservices are hot! However, with many small services there are also many integrations. As we all know, integrations are a hotbed for bugs. End-2-end tests could reduce that risk but it also introduces a new monolith: the tests itself.

Fortunately there is another solution: Contract Testing. A lean way of describing and validating contracts between services. In this talk I will share my experiences with Contract Testing:

- What is contract testing?
- Why do you want it?
- My lessons learned

Slides: to be added soon...
