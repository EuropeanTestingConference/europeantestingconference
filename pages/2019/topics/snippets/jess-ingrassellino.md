In education, we think about every student as someone with the potential to do amazing things, and as teachers, we adjust our strategies to guide our students to the best outcomes for their lives. Management is no different! We absolutely want our teams to receive the best guidance and support that we can offer. This talk will explore the concepts of "differentiated instruction" as they apply to managing and leading a team, so you can make sure that no team member is left behind.
