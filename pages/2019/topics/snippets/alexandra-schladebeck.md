How did we find that bug? What does it mean when we say “we had a feeling that was going to happen”? Can we get more concrete at describing how our brains are working when we do exploratory testing?

Yes, we can. In this talk I’ll talk about the wide variety of heuristics we’re using when we’re doing exploratory testing. I’ll bring examples of ones I’ve noticed and talk about how we can all go about identifying our own and others’ heuristics.

Join this session if you want to improve your exploratory testing, get better at describing what you do, or want to find ways of teaching others about it.
