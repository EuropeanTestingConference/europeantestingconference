Test Driven Development has established itself as a cornerstone of sustainable product delivery. However, what we accept as a common practice for writing our applications has yet to be adopted as usual practice when it comes to infrastructure. In this talk I intend on showcasing a way of building application containers through unit-, functional- and integration testing using ServerSpec, Ruby and Docker(-compose) as a foundation for Continuous Delivery. This will include a live coding example, as well as a step by step introduction and ready-to-use sample code. In the end, hopefully, you will feel empowered to build your on containers using TDD, while playing port authority whenever you ship something to production.
