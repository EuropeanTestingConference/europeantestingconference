Are you a strong exploratory tester that up to now hasn’t had the opportunity to learn more about API’s? Or perhaps you are an API test automation whizz but you want to learn some API exploratory techniques?

This class is not only about learning a new skill, it’s about collaboration. By pairing exploratory and automation expertise together, we will have the opportunity to coach and learn from each other. Time permitting we will discuss how this coaching (and learning) felt, what lessons we learned and what we would do differently next time.

The workshop will begin by focusing on exploratory testing at the GUI level and developing a model and then questioning our model. We will then move to the API learning how to use chrome developer tools and postman to send and receive messages using a REST API.

We finish by performing some API exploratory testing to discover the worst bug!
