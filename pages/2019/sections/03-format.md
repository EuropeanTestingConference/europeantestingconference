Different people learn in different ways. Conferences are great places to try many styles of learning, 
great places to connect to other professionals. At the European Testing Conference we have many styles for
our sessions. 

In the beginning of the conference, we have session geared to connect audience with each other. Making the 
conference more welcoming and less scary place to be. 

Near the end of the conference we create flexible spaces so you'll get the last piece of the puzzle 
ensuring you can take home actionable and relevant insight.
