Nicolas Steenhout offers real-world insight into everyday accessibility issues.

His work began in the mid-'90s. As a developer, he was approached by clients facing challenges not yet part of the public consciousness. On the emerging web, accessibility hurdles were keeping people with disabilities from engaging with a technological revolution.
As Nic began championing web accessibility, he transitioned into the non-profit sector where he collaborated with people with a wide variety of impairments.

Today, Nic continues his accessibility work as an independent consultant for private businesses and non-profits. Having worked on three continents, heâ€™s engaged with thousands of individuals with disabilities.
