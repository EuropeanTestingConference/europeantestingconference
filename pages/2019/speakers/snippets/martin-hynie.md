With almost twenty years of specialization in software testing and development, Martin’s attention has gradually shifted towards embracing uncertainty, and redefining testing as an ongoing transformative research activity. The greatest gains in quality can be found when we emphasize communication, team development, business alignment and organizational learning.

A self-confessed conference junkie, Martin travels the world incorporating ideas introduced by various sources of inspiration (including Cynefin, complexity theory, constraint theory, ontologies, the Satir Model, branding and marketing science, agile principles, marketing, and even progressive natural movement training… no, he is not kidding) to help teams iteratively learn, to embrace failures as opportunities and to simply enjoy working together.
