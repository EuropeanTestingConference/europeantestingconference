Maarten is passionate about helping teams with improving their Test Automation. However Test Automation is mostly on the tech side of the testing spectrum, it's his believe that it is not only about coding a bunch of tests.

The human aspect is way more challenging, especially to make Test Automation a real team effort. He focuses on enhancing cross functional, as well as the cross team collaboration. Because only when you are really working together you get the most out of Test Automation.
