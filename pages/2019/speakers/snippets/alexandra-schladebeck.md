Alex is an outgoing and passionate team leader, consultant, software tester and product owner. Communicating with people is her main focus â€“ something she is fortunate to do frequently in her role as Head of Software Quality and Test Consulting at BREDEX GmbH.

Alex comes from a background in language and linguistics, and has been working in IT since 2005. She spends her time coaching testers and developers, consulting customers and helping development teams to improve their quality. She loves working in agile processes, talking about testing and quality, and encouraging communication magic to happen. She no longer describes herself as non-technical, but she still sees her role as translating between different groups of people in IT.

You'll usually find Alex talking about quality and how it affects the whole development process, or about her life goal to make testing more appreciated! She's also a frequent speaker at conferences where she likes to share her project experiences and learn from other practitioners.
