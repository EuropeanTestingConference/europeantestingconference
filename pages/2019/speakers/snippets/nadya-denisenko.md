I love testing and development. I like experimenting with new testing strategies and strongly believe that testing should be done by machines, so try to automate as much as I can together with development team. Automation doesn’t end with testing and I’m constantly looking for areas to be automated. I see this as my purpose as a test automation engineer and leader.
