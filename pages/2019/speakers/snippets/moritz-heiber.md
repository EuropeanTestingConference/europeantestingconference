I love building things on Linux, especially in clouds. I like reliable infrastructure as code, descriptive provisioning tools and statically typed programming languages. I see it as my destiny to help people achieve serenity using DevOps.

My purpose in life seems to be trying to outsmart computers. I'm really bad at it most of the time.
