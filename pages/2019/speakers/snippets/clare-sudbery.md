Clare Sudbery is a lead consultant developer with ThoughtWorks. She is a maths graduate with 18 years of software engineering experience who has a particular interest in teaching and mentoring, encouraging more women into IT, and banishing impostor syndrome.
Seven years ago she returned to IT with a sigh of relief after a couple of years as a secondary school maths teacher. Since then she has embraced all things XP (especially TDD), and is on a mission to awaken the inner geek in clever women (and men) everywhere.
Clare is a published novelist, and blogs at [https://medium.com/a-woman-in-technology](https://medium.com/a-woman-in-technology) and [https://insimpleterms.blog/](https://insimpleterms.blog/). She loves her job.
