Sarah Wells has been a developer for 15 years, leading delivery teams across consultancy, financial services and media. Over the last few years she has developed a deep interest in operability, observability and devops, and this has recently led to her taking a new role as Technical Director for Operations & Reliability at the Financial Times.

Before that, she lead work at the FT on building a semantic publishing platform, making it easy to discover and access all the FTâ€™s published content via APIs in a common and flexible format. That project meant a focus on Go, microservices, containerisation, kubernetes, and how to influence teams to do the right things.
