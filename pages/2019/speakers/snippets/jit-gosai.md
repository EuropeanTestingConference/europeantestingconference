Iâ€™ve been a test professional for the past 15 years and have always strived to help software teams be the best they can be.

I've seen first hand what does and doesn't work in improving the quality of our products.
From highly regulated financial services in the days of Waterfall to the emergence of agile in mobile phone development to the DevOps movement with mobile apps.

I now want to take these skills and experiences to help others support their own teams to be the best they can by improving quality through testability.
