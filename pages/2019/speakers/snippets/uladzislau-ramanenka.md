I work at Badoo as Senior iOS QA engineer. Before moving from Minsk to London and joining Badoo in 2018, I got some experience on various outsourcing projects. They included mobile applications, complex web projects and some backend testing.

All started a few years ago when I decided to drastically change my field of occupation. Thus after calm land management I plunged into the raging sea of software testing.

Now, I try to actively participate in different testing-related events, meet new people and benefit from knowledge-sharing. I spoke at several international conferences and local meetups. Also I like to challenge myself at various software testing competitions (like [itchallenges.me](https://itchallenges.me/) and Testathon).
