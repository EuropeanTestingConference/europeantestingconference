<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>“SHIFT LEFT!”
“CI!”
“FAIL FAST!”
“TESTING IS A CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISE THAT HELPS US BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM AND THE IMPLICATIONS…. sigh…”</p>

<p>Let’s be honest, truly transformational ideas are rarely easy to get started, but some ideas are certainly stickier than others. We have seen some excellent changes happen in our industry that have really advanced our ability to build software faster… but where are the sticky changes that really focus on quality and testing? We have some of the worlds great thinkers writing about this. The world demands quality… but it still feels like a  dogfight every time.</p>

<p>Inevitably, it becomes a prolonged (and ongoing) discussion point rather than a movement. Is there any way we can take advantage of the power of momentum? Is it all about clever terms and catchy phrases? Or is there more to marketing and branding that we just are not taking into consideration?</p>

<p>Is there a science to branding? Short answer… yes. And we really need to start to pay attention.</p>

<p>In this workshop, we will explore what the world of branding and marketing can teach the testing community. Areas of exploration include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The science of measuring market energy and disposition</li>
  <li>Performance as authenticity</li>
  <li>Incremental idea injection and experimentation</li>
  <li>Researching market categorization</li>
  <li>What the world of online dating can teach us (no really… this is super important)</li>
</ul>

<p>Bring your challenges. Bring the testing transformations you want to see happen at your workplace. Bring your frustrations, your hopes and your concerns. Together, let’s explore what the world of branding might share with us, and tap into some of the worlds most effective methods for connecting great ideas with real energy for change.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Testing for web accessibility can feel daunting when you aren’t used to it. But with the growing requirements for sites to meet accessibility guidelines, it has become an unescapable part of a developer’s life. Accessibility should be seen as a challenge, rather than a chore.</p>

<p>This workshop will demonstrate an accessibility testing workflow that can be integrated in coding workflow, and will include a review of automated testing, and hands-on manual testing using a variety of tools, from using the keyboard to using a screen reader application. We will work on real life sites, as well as some code snippets.</p>

<p>Participants will leave the workshop with a solid understanding of common accessibility barriers and methods to test for, and remediate, these barriers.</p>

<p>How did we find that bug? What does it mean when we say “we had a feeling that was going to happen”? Can we get more concrete at describing how our brains are working when we do exploratory testing?</p>

<p>Yes, we can. In this talk I’ll talk about the wide variety of heuristics we’re using when we’re doing exploratory testing. I’ll bring examples of ones I’ve noticed and talk about how we can all go about identifying our own and others’ heuristics.</p>

<p>Join this session if you want to improve your exploratory testing, get better at describing what you do, or want to find ways of teaching others about it.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Do you code on your own? Do you use TDD? Do you write unit tests? Do you understand exactly what the benefits of TDD and unit testing are?</p>

<p>Recently, Sal Freudenberg and I have been remote-pairing on an iOS puzzle app. The reason I asked Sal to join me is that my testing strategy was getting more and more lax, and the quality of the code was suffering.</p>

<p>I love playing this app, which makes me not only software engineer but also end user, product owner, business stakeholder, and everything else. As a user I wanted new features and I wanted them NOW. I didn’t care about the tests - I just wanted a better game! But the increasing lack of tests made the code harder and harder to extend.</p>

<p>I stopped testing for bad reasons, but then started again for good ones. This experience allowed me to demonstrate in practice the impact it can have on your code base when you stop testing.</p>

<p>This talk, based on simple practical examples, will explain exactly why unit tests, a TDD approach and pairing make all the difference to your code.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>In education, we think about every student as someone with the potential to do amazing things, and as teachers, we adjust our strategies to guide our students to the best outcomes for their lives. Management is no different! We absolutely want our teams to receive the best guidance and support that we can offer. This talk will explore the concepts of “differentiated instruction” as they apply to managing and leading a team, so you can make sure that no team member is left behind.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Microservices are hot! However, with many small services there are also many integrations. As we all know, integrations are a hotbed for bugs. End-2-end tests could reduce that risk but it also introduces a new monolith: the tests itself.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is another solution: Contract Testing. A lean way of describing and validating contracts between services. In this talk I will share my experiences with Contract Testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is contract testing?</li>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Test Driven Development has established itself as a cornerstone of sustainable product delivery. However, what we accept as a common practice for writing our applications has yet to be adopted as usual practice when it comes to infrastructure. In this talk I intend on showcasing a way of building application containers through unit-, functional- and integration testing using ServerSpec, Ruby and Docker(-compose) as a foundation for Continuous Delivery. This will include a live coding example, as well as a step by step introduction and ready-to-use sample code. In the end, hopefully, you will feel empowered to build your on containers using TDD, while playing port authority whenever you ship something to production.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Mobile test automation was born at the beginning of mobile apps development and became popular for the last 5 years. It existed for a while already on big projects in big companies. However, the majority of mobile developers have been raised with a manual testing mindset and it’s a huge challenge for us, test automation engineers, to change that attitude. Here I’d like to share my 7 year’s journey in mobile test automation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why mobile is different than other platforms (web, backend)</li>
  <li>What are the tools being used and how are they different</li>
  <li>Where mobile automation can go wrong</li>
  <li>And finally, how to fix it</li>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Have you heard about TestSphere? It’s a deck of cards designed to get you thinking and talking about testing. I was inspired by them and wanted to use them more in my everyday work.
So I decided to start a “30-day TestSphere challenge”: for each of my testing tasks, I randomly pick up a card and try to apply the idea from it within my testing activities.
I’d like to be honest and in the talk I will present which ideas worked and which didn’t. I hope that my example will inspire the others to think wider, be more creative and effective in testing.</p>
