	 		<p>A progressive type, Ash focuses her efforts within technology on bringing awareness to inclusion of women and people of color, especially in the Context Driven Testing and Agile communities. Though technology and inclusion have her heart today, engineering was not her first love. A former chef, Ash crafted her software approach through the learnings of hospitality. After 16 years, she put recipes aside when she began her career in software development, falling back on her skills in engineering she acquired as a kid building computers with her brother. An avid fan of matching business needs with technological solutions, you can find her doing her best work on whichever coast is the sunniest. Having helped teams build out testing practices, formulate Agile processes and redefine culture, she now works as an Engineering Manager for Credit Karma and continues consulting based out of San Francisco.</p>

	 		<p>Dr. Sallyann Freudenberg is a software developer, agile consultant and trainer who assists companies in transitioning to more nimble, customer-centric and human(e) ways of working. She holds a PhD in the Psychology of Collaborative Software Development and since parenting an autistic son has developed an interest in neurodiversity. Through re-assessing her own traits and neurology, and considering the extra-ordinary people with whom she has worked over her 25+ years in tech, Sal is raising awareness of the benefits of having diversity in our organisations, and is helping the industry to begin to understand how to support and nurture every kind of brain.</p>

	 		<p>Sarah Wells has been a developer for 15 years, leading delivery teams across consultancy, financial services and media. Over the last few years she has developed a deep interest in operability, observability and devops, and this has recently led to her taking a new role as Technical Director for Operations &amp; Reliability at the Financial Times.</p>

<p>Before that, she lead work at the FT on building a semantic publishing platform, making it easy to discover and access all the FT’s published content via APIs in a common and flexible format.

	 		<p>Alex is an outgoing and passionate team leader, consultant, software tester and product owner. Communicating with people is her main focus – something she is fortunate to do frequently in her role as Head of Software Quality and Test Consulting at BREDEX GmbH.</p>

<p>Alex comes from a background in language and linguistics, and has been working in IT since 2005. She spends her time coaching testers and developers, consulting customers and helping development teams to improve their quality. She loves working in agile processes, talking about testing and quality, and encouraging communication magic to happen. She no longer describes herself as non-technical, but she still sees her role as translating between different groups of people in IT.</p>

<p>You’ll usually find Alex talking about quality and how it affects the whole development process, or about her life goal to make testing more appreciated! She’s also a frequent speaker at conferences where she likes to share her project experiences and learn from other practitioners.</p>

	 		<p>The important things are mindsets! They will change you!” is Lucian’s  motto. He is currently working at <a href="https://www.rga.com/">R/GA</a> where he has the opportunity to work with new technologies, brilliant design people and crafty developers, this blend resulting in award winning &amp; innovative user experiences. His journey into testing started in 2005, and since then he took interest in many things related to testing &amp; agile His testing experience covers a wide variety of software, ranging from networking &amp; embedded to mobile apps, going through security and desktop applications.
Exposure to varied types of software lead Lucian to believe that applied coaching methods, communication and technical excellency are key ingredients for successful teams and product.</p>

<p>His latest interest is in exploring the interaction between users, computer interfaces, and data driven methods (e.g. AI, ML).

	 		<p>I love testing and development. I like experimenting with new testing strategies and strongly believe that testing should be done by machines, so try to automate as much as I can together with development team.

	 		<p>I work at Badoo as Senior iOS QA engineer. Before moving from Minsk to London and joining Badoo in 2018, I got some experience on various outsourcing projects. They included mobile applications, complex web projects and some backend testing.</p>

<p>All started a few years ago when I decided to drastically change my field of occupation. Thus after calm land management I plunged into the raging sea of software testing.</p>

<p>Now, I try to actively participate in different testing-related events, meet new people and benefit from knowledge-sharing. I spoke at several international conferences and local meetups. Also I like to challenge myself at various software testing competitions (like <a href="https://itchallenges.me/">itchallenges.me</a> and Testathon).</p>
