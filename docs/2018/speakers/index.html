	 		<p>Zeger Van Hese (born and raised in Belgium) has a background in Commercial Engineering and Cultural Science. He started his professional career in the movie distribution industry but switched to IT in 1999. A year later he got bitten by the software testing bug (pun intended) and has never been cured since. Over the years, he developed a passion for exploratory testing, testing in agile projects and, above all, continuous learning from different perspectives. He was the 2012 Eurostar program chair and founded his own company, Z-sharp, dedicated to helping clients on the path to smarter testing. He is co-founder of the Dutch Exploratory Workshop on Testing (DEWT), muses about testing on his TestSideStory blog and is a regular speaker at conferences worldwide. He makes sketchnotes for fun.

	 		<p>Abby is currently working at ThoughtWorks where over the last 6 years she has had the opportunity to work in a variety of domains, countries, and team dynamics. Throughout these experience it has become clear to her that while the technical requirements of each domain and tech stack can be challenging, team practices and team ownership have a much deeper impact on the end deliverable.</p>

<p>After 5 years of working on mainly web and desktop apps Abby has shifted into a more infrastructure and operations focus. Her goal is to help incorporate the same team practices that have success in software delivery to the infrastructure and tooling which supports that software in production.

Ever since graduating as a Master of Computer Science he’s worked in various technical IT positions. When he started testing, it clicked, and Ron fully concentrated on software quality in 2008. He then successfully built up browser and app automation frameworks and established test teams in Germany and the UK when working for conject AG, a leading international construction software company.
He now works in consulting as Mobile Testing Lead for QualityMinds in Munich. Next to building up a team of mobile testers he has been engaged in various exciting projects.
