<!--<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Kevlin/the-error-of-our-ways">[Slides]</a>-->

<p>When visuals come under test automation, the outcome rarely justifies
the cost. Visual tests tend to be too brittle, to difficult to
maintain, and too slow to execute for quick iterative delivery cycles.
However, recent improvements in cloud computing and browser
capabilities make it possible to change the economics of the test
automation pyramid. Gojko will talk propose a new view, looking at how
trends such as approval testing, cloud functions and automated image
analysis can help us automate acceptance/regression tests for visual
look and feel in a visual language, rather than xUnit style code, and
make such tests easy to write, understand, execute and maintain.</p>

<p>Since the days before recorded history, dogs have been man’s best friend. Dogs obey the pack rules based on an established hierarchy, providing stability for the greater good. With their positivity and teamwork ability, dogs demonstrate traits that are admirable in a friend, colleague or employee. As an industry, software testers have dog traits well ingrained in our culture. It is time to move beyond, and while keeping the good traits we can learn from dogs, incorporate more tricks from cats.</p>

<p>Cats have a different history, being revered as Gods in ancient Egypt. They have yet to forget it. Cats will be fine with or without our approval or intervention, giving them a distinct survival advantage. Cats are charming with an alluring purr that contributes to healing as well as soothing the stress of their human companions. Feline traits like patience and seeing in the dark are a huge advantage when lacking vital information. Cats come equipped with whiskers (an excellent adaptable tool of self-awareness) that help them determine in advance what routes are possible, and which to rule out. Like cats, modern testers may share separate territory, be a part of a larger testing group, or be a lone feral tester in the wilds of an Agile project. Testers may have abundant requirements and ability to question developers, or they may have absolutely nothing. If they test like a cat they will survive either way.</p>

<p>Saying software testing is dead is dead. The dog days of testing are over. Don’t work like a dog. Test like a cat!</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<!--<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Kevlin/the-error-of-our-ways">[Slides]</a>-->

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>These might just be the hardest words to say in any language. We avoid saying them, scared of coming across as doubtful and uncertain. Colleagues expect us to be firm and certain, providing clear answers. Over the past years, I grew increasingly uncomfortable with that. I ended up having a hard time being sure of anything.</p>

<p>“You’re rejecting certainty”, someone said. “That’s skepticism. You’re a tester, embrace it!”</p>

<p>That sounded like a good idea, but this left me with a new challenge: how does one embrace skepticism, and how can this help me improve my testing?</p>

<p>I wanted to get to the bottom of this and, for a year, decided to submerge myself in all things skeptic in hope of finding clues to help me with my testing. It was a fascinating journey that led me from philosophy, critical thinking and science to pseudo-science and the paranormal.</p>

<p>This is the story of how I embraced skepticism and how this influenced my testing: by adopting a skeptic manifesto and creating a portfolio of critical thinking heuristics that can be a valuable addition to any tester’s toolbox. You will leave armed with tips not only on how to muster up the courage to admit not knowing things, but also on improving your questioning skills and reflexes to reject certainty, empowered by the biggest skeptical force of all: knowing that we’re easy to fool.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>The goal of this workshop is to familiarize the participants with a series of tools and concepts that are useful in the DevOps world. We will start from zero and in the end we will have a continuous delivery environment set up. Everything is hands-on. As a prerequisite, you need Ubuntu 16.04 running (VM or on your computer). 
In the beginning we will have a setup phase and we will discuss the tools and concepts that we will be working with. Then, we will go to the practical part, where we will configure everything. We will close with conclusions and Q&amp;A. After this workshop, you will have the environment all set up and you can continue exploring after the conference, if you feel like it.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<!--<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Kevlin/the-error-of-our-ways">[Slides]</a>-->

<p>Exploratory testing isn’t just for websites and mobile applications - the same techniques can help you test at the API level as well! Tools like Postman make it easier than ever to learn about the services that power your application. This session will cover multiple ways in which Postman can aid your API testing, including proxies, mocking, authentication, header management, and much more. Don’t limit yourself to the surface of your application - by exploring your APIs, you can increase your overall understanding of your application, find critical issues earlier in the development cycle, and provide a solid base for UI testing. Plus it’s fun!</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Behaviour Driven Development is an agile development technique that improves collaboration between technical and non-­technical members of the team, by exploring the problem using examples. These examples then get turned into executable specifications, often called ‘scenarios’. The scenarios should be easy to read by all team members, but writing them expressively is harder than it looks!</p>

<p>In this workshop you will learn how to write expressive BDD scenarios. We’ll start by giving you a very brief introduction to BDD/ATDD. You’ll then be introduced to different writing styles by reviewing pre­prepared scenarios. Finally, you’ll get a chance to write your own scenarios based on examples that we’ll bring along.</p>

<p>We’ll be using Gherkin, the syntax used by Cucumber and SpecFlow ­ but you won’t need a computer. And, you’ll leave with a checklist of tips that you can use the next time you sit down to write a scenario.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<!--<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Kevlin/the-error-of-our-ways">[Slides]</a>-->

<p>“Copy… paste… modify one line… done!”</p>

<p>Writing system-level automation can be quite complex - and for some odd reason, many testers have their first work-related coding in this area. Luckily, the internet is here to help. There are many good advice on everything we might need -There are (open source) tools that cover the upper layers: Frameworks that support BDD or KDT, enable easy maintenance of multiple test suites and re-running failed tests. There are awesome tools that cover the lower layers that enable driving browsers or mobile devices, send REST or SOAP requests and generally do whatever we might want to do.
So how come our test-code is so difficult to maintain? Why doesn’t it look as pretty as the examples we find online?</p>

<p>The reason for that is that the advice we find are missing one part - the part where no generic tool can really help you: Organizing the business actions in a way that is easy to both maintain and use.</p>

<p>In this talk we’ll go over three ways of organizing your automation middle layer  - from a quick gain for the short term that you probably already use, to something a bit more elaborate that your future selves may not hate.</p>

<p>Main statement: Multiply your knowledge by finding your ‘testing buddy’ anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The product development and testing world has never experienced such a boom as it has in recent years. Tons of concepts are thrown at you in the digital world via tweets, blog posts, podcasts, and more. Inspiration can be found everywhere you look. But would these insights work in your professional environment as well? Pair up and learn by sharing actual experiences!</p>

<p>Accomplishing something major in your industry or company has always been at the top of your list, but you struggle to find the motivation and drive to do so? Collaborate and inspire each other to achieve your ultimate goals!</p>

<p>Come with us on our journey on how we found each other and what we have learned so far. Pairing up was one of the best experiences we had, so we want to spread the word and encourage you to give it a try. The conference doesn’t have to end on the day you leave - it’s where the fun begins and relationships grow!</p>

<p>Discover how people from different continents, countries, companies, and cultures can work together to achieve one common goal. The answer to gaining the desired knowledge might be sitting with a peer in another part of the world - so break down the barriers of distance, share your ideas and experiences, and find your personal testing buddy!</p>

<!--<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Kevlin/the-error-of-our-ways">[Slides]</a>-->

<p>Empower teams to help be on the same page and help ourselves in return for better focus on QA</p>

<p>In this talk, we will discuss about unleashing the power of existing systems like github, slack and some awesome open-source technologies to create a code monitoring and talking bot which can keep everyone across teams, up to date and be a helper in need by preventing/resolving the situation of conflicts. Will also be sharing exactly how I leveraged the power of existing systems &amp; created it and how this can be useful for many of your use cases at work.</p>

<h4 id="why-should-you-attend-this"><strong>Why should you attend this:</strong></h4>
<p>Imagine, it is one of your Release Day and the code started breaking all of a sudden, tested features not working anymore, and it is going to take time to figure out whom to reach &amp; people start passing the buck? Experienced such stormy sail on your release day? Amidst all this, losing time for release deployment as the traffic on your product is peaking up or exceeding the deadline promised to the clients. Manual monitoring doesn’t look a viable/scalable solution ? Yes, in fast paced organisations like us, it is a burning problem. Do you also feel the same?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Already nodding your head in agreement? Many times somewhere deep down, did you feel like escaping from the heated discussion or wished there were snapshots of all the important events which could give you the clues/traceback to hunt &amp; chuck the wrong commits out of the system and move ahead. Or even better some software which you could just hook to your system which would never let us reach such a chaotic state itself by blocking/notifying any wrong doings.</li>
  <li>Or are you someone just starting off your company and do not want to go through the same challenges we went through &amp; help your developers focus only on building the awesome stuff which you wanted to</li>

<p>Empower teams to help be on the same page and help ourselves in return for better focus on QA</p>

<p>In this talk, we will discuss about unleashing the power of existing systems like github, slack and some awesome open-source technologies to create a code monitoring and talking bot which can keep everyone across teams, up to date and be a helper in need by preventing/resolving the situation of conflicts. Will also be sharing exactly how I leveraged the power of existing systems &amp; created it and how this can be useful for many of your use cases at work.</p>

<h4 id="why-should-you-attend-this"><strong>Why should you attend this:</strong></h4>
<p>Imagine, it is one of your Release Day and the code started breaking all of a sudden, tested features not working anymore, and it is going to take time to figure out whom to reach &amp; people start passing the buck? Experienced such stormy sail on your release day? Amidst all this, losing time for release deployment as the traffic on your product is peaking up or exceeding the deadline promised to the clients. Manual monitoring doesn’t look a viable/scalable solution ? Yes, in fast paced organisations like us, it is a burning problem. Do you also feel the same?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Already nodding your head in agreement? Many times somewhere deep down, did you feel like escaping from the heated discussion or wished there were snapshots of all the important events which could give you the clues/traceback to hunt &amp; chuck the wrong commits out of the system and move ahead. Or even better some software which you could just hook to your system which would never let us reach such a chaotic state itself by blocking/notifying any wrong doings.</li>
  <li>Or are you someone just starting off your company and do not want to go through the same challenges we went through &amp; help your developers focus only on building the awesome stuff which you wanted to</li>
  <li>Or are you among those telling yourself “we have already solved it”. As a tech geek, are you excited to explore a different way as to how we are solving it?</li>
</ul>
