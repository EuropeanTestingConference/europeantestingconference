	 		<p>Hi, I’m Maaike. Like many other people in testing, I accidentally became a tester. I got an opportunity to test for the business in the “User Acceptance Phase” and found out that I love asking “why” and trying to find out how systems work. This was 10 years ago, but it feels like a lifetime ago!</p>

<p>In these 10 years, I’ve seen testing and the role of the tester change. A lot. I had to change as well. But some things remain the same: my love for asking questions and finding out how systems work.</p>

<p>In the testing community, I’m known for my work in the exploratory testing and critical thinking domain. It’s my mission to make more people aware how our work is shaped by our own cognitive biases and (lack of) critical thinking. I try to fill in the role as tester as broad as possible because I don’t like to be put in a box. I’m a tester, but I can do so much more than that.</p>

	 		<p>Patricia is a programmer who has worked mostly in C++ and Java. She has spent her career continuously delivering from the same code-base to a large user base, from working on two browsers (Opera and Vivaldi), to working on embedded telepresence endpoints for Cisco. She is focused on the maintainability and flexibility of software architecture, and how to extend it to provide cutting edge user experiences.</p>

<p>Her focus on the end users has led her work more and more toward privacy and security, and she has recently started her own company, TurtleSec, hoping to contribute positively to the infosec and C++ communities. She is also involved in the #include&lt;C++&gt; organization hoping to improve diversity and inclusion in the C++ community.</p>

	 		<p>Joep wandered into testing in 2006. Two years later he discovered context-driven and realized that testing is actually not that bad a fit for a philosopher. In 2015 he joined Mendix, one reason being that he wanted to increase his technical skills. Since then he’s become more and more involved in automation, while also taking on the roles of scrum master, then team lead, and as of October 2018 tech lead testing. Somewhere along his journey (some say it was 2013) he started speaking at conferences and joined DEWT. Outside of work his thoughts tend to revolve around coffee, fountain pens and bouldering.</p>
