	 		<p>Hi, I’m Maaike. Like many other people in testing, I accidentally became a tester. I got an opportunity to test for the business in the “User Acceptance Phase” and found out that I love asking “why” and trying to find out how systems work. This was 10 years ago, but it feels like a lifetime ago!</p>

<p>In these 10 years, I’ve seen testing and the role of the tester change. A lot. I had to change as well. But some things remain the same: my love for asking questions and finding out how systems work.</p>

<p>In the testing community, I’m known for my work in the exploratory testing and critical thinking domain. It’s my mission to make more people aware how our work is shaped by our own cognitive biases and (lack of) critical thinking. I try to fill in the role as tester as broad as possible because I don’t like to be put in a box. I’m a tester, but I can do so much more than that.</p>

While programming has been a hobby ever since, my career didn’t start in that field at all. I was an accountant, management assistant and office administrator. Later I started to work as a dogtrainer with main focus on behavioral issues. After many years working with people and their dogs I changed my career for the second time and became a frontend developer.</p>

	 		<p>Patricia is a programmer who has worked mostly in C++ and Java. She has spent her career continuously delivering from the same code-base to a large user base, from working on two browsers (Opera and Vivaldi), to working on embedded telepresence endpoints for Cisco. She is focused on the maintainability and flexibility of software architecture, and how to extend it to provide cutting edge user experiences.</p>

<p>Her focus on the end users has led her work more and more toward privacy and security, and she has recently started her own company, TurtleSec, hoping to contribute positively to the infosec and C++ communities. She is also involved in the #include&lt;C++&gt; organization hoping to improve diversity and inclusion in the C++ community.</p>

	 		<p>Amanda Nobil is a Sr. Staff Test Engineer at Medidata Solutions, Inc. She started out in public policy and administration as well as law and legal studies, but began what she thought would be a “rebound relationship” with testing after moving to the San Francisco Bay Area. Many years later, she finds herself instead as part of a loving, if cheeky, union with code based on mutual respect and admiration.</p>

<p>Amanda often finds herself in a number of roles within a role: Investigator, Doctor, and Psychologist to name the most prominent few. However, she is of the opinion that such is testing and such is life.</p>

<p>When not uttering either the words, “Wait, but why?” or “Let’s explore that <em>feature/thought/statement/etc.</em> a little
more,” you can find her observing (lurking?) on Twitter or thinking a lot about testing, software, and her place in that
realm.</p>

	 		<p>Bernardo Guerreiro, from Portugal and living in London, is a Software Engineer with a focus on Release and Testing. He
has a wide range of experiences, ranging from device automation to testing of distributed systems, both from a frontend
and backend perspective. In particular, he has solid hands-on experience of implementing Contract Testing at a large
scale on a micro-services architecture. Recently he has been very interested in how DevOps can complement the role of
Quality Assurance in an organisation, and in trying to solve company-wide problems by being involved in architecting and
building infrastructure and tooling to support multiple teams. He currently works for DAZN, the leading sports streaming
service in the world.</p>

<p>On a personal note, he likes to spend his spare time with his partner and friends, is an avid traveller, and now enjoys
card games as a hobby (having formerly played some of them on a professional level).</p>

	 		<p>Joep wandered into testing in 2006. Two years later he discovered context-driven and realized that testing is actually not that bad a fit for a philosopher. In 2015 he joined Mendix, one reason being that he wanted to increase his technical skills. Since then he’s become more and more involved in automation, while also taking on the roles of scrum master, then team lead, and as of October 2018 tech lead testing. Somewhere along his journey (some say it was 2013) he started speaking at conferences. Outside of work his thoughts tend to revolve around coffee, fountain pens and bouldering.</p>

	 		<p>Jokin as been a Software Tester since 2008, he had moved from Waterfall to Agile, from Test cases to Exploratory testing, from Excel to Rapid Software Testing. He has learnt from James Bach &amp; Michael Bolton, from Huib choots &amp; Richard Bradshaw, from Lisa Crispin &amp; Fiona Charles, from Pekka Marjamäki &amp; Martin Hynie … and one night he invited Pradeep Soundararajan to dinner, so he knows about the secret sauce of testing.
In this year 2019 he has changed role, and now performs as Product Owner in Flywire, using his old tester skills and learning the Product Owning thing.</p>
