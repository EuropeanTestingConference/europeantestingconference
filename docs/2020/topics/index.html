<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Before I started my career in software development, I worked for many years as a dog trainer. The experiences I made in this time are the reason why I immediately fell in love with testing. So, let’s talk about TDD! TDD stand for Test-driven development and it’s not only a technique to write tests but also a design process in software development. I want to give you a new perspective on this process and explain how to TDD with the help of comparing it to how to train a dog. TDD has much in common with dogtraining, so at the end of my talk you should be able to write a piece of c test driven code, and also teach a dog a little trick - well, the last thing at least theoretically.</p>

	<h3 class="b-topic__title"><a href="/2020/speakers#fiona-charles">Fiona Charles</a> -  Boost Your Leadership Capability with Heuristics</h3>
	
	


<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Do you do these things with your team members?</p>

<p>•	Challenge them to solve their own problems</p>

<p>•	Motivate them with frequent feedback</p>

<p>•	Empower them to make their own mistakes</p>

<p>Leaders often base their daily interactions with team members on similar premises. But do they always work? 
Good leaders know that no leadership practice is universally applicable. We don’t apply “standard” practices blindly.
Instead, we prefer to evaluate any practice for fit with a given team member in a particular circumstance. Perhaps we
also develop and selectively apply our own practices. This is using practices heuristically—as imperfect models or rules
of thumb that we can call on when they seem appropriate and useful.
By consciously adopting heuristic methods, we can help grow our practice of leadership from black art to something more
closely resembling science. We can expand our capabilities.</p>

<p>In this interactive workshop, participants will work in teams to share or develop heuristics for leadership, and then apply their own experiences to evaluate them critically. 
We’ll have fun exploring the practices of test leadership and developing a set of positive heuristics that can help us
all become more effective leaders in our daily work.</p>

<p>This workshop is for testers, test managers, test leads — anyone who is or wants to become a test leader.</p>

	<h3 class="b-topic__title"><a href="/2020/speakers#janet-gregory">Janet Gregory &amp; Lisa Crispin</a> -  Exploring Features and Stories - Help Your Team Build Shared Understanding</h3>
	
	


<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Do you ever have this experience: Your team discusses a story in the planning meeting, codes and tests using good practices, delivers it to the product owner or customer - who then rejects it because it wasn’t what they wanted. We see this all too frequently, even on experienced agile teams. It leads to long cycle times, high rejection rates, wasted time and general frustration.
We don’t want to get stuck in “analysis paralysis”, but we do need to make sure that everyone on the cross-functional product team shares the same understanding of each story they need to deliver before they begin testing and coding. Teams also need to remember there are many different quality attributes that may be critical to a product’s success.</p>

<p>In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn techniques such as the 7 dimensions of quality to help you apply your testing mindset to elicit examples and business rules from stakeholders. You’ll practice turning those into test scenarios that guide development of the right things, so that your team can deliver value to the business frequently and predictably.</p>

<p><strong>Learning takeaways:</strong></p>

<p>•	Ways to explore requirements and do deliberate discovery, in a timely manner, to uncover missing, conflicting, erroneous and unnecessary requirements.</p>

<p>•	Techniques from agile business analysis and agile testing models that help teams scope each feature and deliver acceptable value to the business, considering all relevant quality attributes.</p>

<p>•	How to use your testing mindset and conversation frameworks to help your whole team build shared understanding for each feature and story, shortening cycle time and reducing rejections.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Failure can be catastrophic and speed to market is a critical business advantage, putting development teams under more
pressure than ever to get software from concept to customer in as short a time frame as possible.Speed is a key factor,
and to have speed you need an understanding of the impact of any change.
You need to know how high performing teams achieve the seemingly impossible task of delivering valuable software while
increasing speed and frequency - without compromising quality.</p>

<p>Teams need to adopt a relentless focus on Testability, eliminating anything that makes testing difficult, slow, wasteful or less trustworthy.
A whole team focus on Testability shortens feedback loops and accelerates learning while enabling more robust
automation, as well as deep, meaningful testing.</p>

<p>In this workshop, you’ll work with core concepts and models used to explain and advocate for Testability. Participants
will work through a series of exercises that I have used through my career from Tester to Test Coach. The exercises will
help to identify and address testing debt as well as establish a whole team focus on Testability.</p>

<p>This workshop is aimed at anyone involved in software delivery but would be most beneficial for developers and testers.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<p>After the workshop you will:</p>

<p>•	Understand and explain Testability, the factors that influence Testability and the impact testing debt has on a teams
productivity.</p>

<p>•	Identify and address architectural Testability problems using a combination of models and practical exercises.</p>

<p>•	Identify and address holistic, whole team Testability problems using a combination of models and practical exercises.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s small and the damage can be mitigated or reversed quickly. Maybe it’s not so small, and it sends your team, and maybe even your whole organization, into a frenzy.</p>

<p>This is our nightmare scenario. We feel inadequate. We feel it is our fault for missing something so “obvious”…but was

	<h3 class="b-topic__title"><a href="/2020/speakers#bernardo-guerreiro">Bernardo Guerreiro</a> -  Get with the Pact - "Gotchas" of implementing Contract Testing the right way</h3>
	
	


<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>So you need to test micro-services, and you’ve been hearing Consumer Driven Contract Testing (CDCT) with Pact is the cool
new thing on the block? It seems like it perfectly fits what you need. You might even go ahead and give it ago, run a
proof of concept yourself or have a few developers/testers try it. And if this is gonna work, the ideal is that all your
teams use it - otherwise you will have blind spots in your testing approach. But how do you go from a proof of concept
to several teams adopting it? How do you make sure everyone is doing the right things and has the proper understanding
of Pact? How do you avoid mistakes by people who didn’t take the proper time to understand this tool? How do you get
through Pact’s learning curve and make sure you are not misunderstanding it yourself?</p>

<p>In this workshop, we are going to try to work as a company with teams looking to adopt CDCT, with a focus on avoiding some pitfalls that might cost you time and money.</p>

<p>What can you look to gain from this workshop?</p>

<p>•	A deeper understanding of Contract Testing through the use of Pact;</p>

<p>•	Knowledge on important concepts like versioning, tagging and naming conventions;</p>

<p>•	Insight on Pact’s learning curve, and some mistakes people tend to make;</p>

<p>•	An idea on how the Pact workflow works from a simulated hands-on situation.</p>

<p>You can get more out of this workshop if you already have some beginner/intermediate knowledge of Pact. However, we will
briefly go through some basics, and at the very least you can pick up some important notes and tips along the way. So,
all are welcome!</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>We have heard a lot about mob programming and mob testing, but what if you actually start doing it? And stick with it, even if the first sessions aren’t that great? Well, that’s what we did! We’ll tell stories of our weekly mob testing sessions, what issues we uncovered (spoiler: not many), what we learned (spoiler: lots) and how we got better at it over time.</p>

<p>We started mob testing once a week this past February: four testers from four different teams and one facilitator. The biggest hurdle we faced was learning how to collaborate as a mob. We knew we were getting somewhere when a few people went “Ooh!” simultaneously. We were surprised by how many different things we learned: about each other’s products, operating systems, tools, languages, and keyboard shortcuts. To be honest, we haven’t gotten to a point where we find a lot of bugs yet. And we don’t know that we ever will.</p>

<p>However, we have been learning so many useful things that we have no plans to stop mob testing anytime soon. The lessons we learned are worth more than any bugs we could find. By sticking with mob testing, we have built good habits that have made us better collaborators.</p>

	<h3 class="b-topic__title"><a href="/2020/speakers#gem-hill">Gem Hill</a> -  Value and Visibility; How to figure out both when you don't do any hands on testing</h3>
	
	


<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>How do you figure out where and how to add value once you stop doing hands on testing day to day?
In 2018 I was promoted to Senior tester when I moved to a new department. This meant I was on two teams, both with full time testers, so there wasn’t a lot of work for me to test. Suddenly I had to balance two teams, but not day to day testing, and no team lead responsibilities.</p>

<p>I wanted to make sure I was adding value to these teams and the testers on them without taking work away from them or getting in the way. I also wanted to make sure I knew the value I was adding - without knowing the value I bring, I had no idea what I needed to strengthen in or what skills to add to my toolbox.
But I’d never had a job that was focused solely on the non-technical skills of testing before! Suddenly my priorities were being visible, driving communication and strategy: all things that have few ‘solid’ goals!</p>

<p>This talk will cover what I’ve learned in the past year and a half of this role, some successes, some failures, and some
tools I discovered to help me.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Static analysis tools are often used as an enterprise standard because management wants to track metrics, so the team
gets their code in there then forgets about it - out of sight, out of mind. But for someone looking for areas of risk in
a codebase, static analysis tools are a treasure trove of information that is usually difficult to track down manually
or even with test automation. In this session we’ll use the map provided to us by static analysis to find areas of risk
from bugs, duplications, code coverage (or lack thereof), and complexity. We can further analyze these hazards to get a
clearer picture of the actual risks, or take immediate action to reduce that risk by killing them off. And if you’re not
using static analysis tools just yet, you’ll learn about just how invaluable they are to the entire team, not just
management!</p>

question numerous times; I’ve trained myself to do so, because I understand its importance. However, I’m often left
baffled by colleagues and other testers who reject the idea of deleting a test. Why do they find it such a scary
concept? So the result is that we continuously look and review the same tests, not knowing if they’re mitigating any
risks, or worse, not knowing what they are testing anymore. But if you’re like me, you’ve probably looked at some
failing tests before that left you thinking “why does this even exist?!”. That trigger is one you shouldn’t ignore.</p>

<p>In this talk, I’m going to share my experiences of listening to this trigger, but more importantly, I’ll explain
the actions I take. You’ll learn how to analyze the full lifecycle of an automated test to truly understand its value.
We’ll talk about the total cost of ownership of a test, and how it is a key analysis factor when attempting to reduce
feedback loops. I’ll bring some stories from the company I work for to support this. After all, we’ve gone from
automated regression environments running thousands of tests overnight to a CI/CD reality. I love my delete key, I hope
to share the love!</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Being a tester is a lifetime journey, but working as a software tester is just temporary. I transitioned to a new Product Owner role, and found some of the skills I had as a tester to be far more useful than I expected. I also found out about a bunch of skills that I now wanted to learn.
My talk is around these skills, the ones I had, and the ones I’m still missing.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Did you ever struggle consuming an API that kept on changing? Did you provide an API that you were unsure how people will use it? 
In such a scenario, an iterative and cooperative way of working that focuses on consumer driven contract testing can reduce your pain. In other words, an experience with “Consumer collaboration over contract negotiation”.</p>

<p>This talk aims to practically illustrate consumer driven testing using Pact. We will cover when this technique is appropriate and how to organise, define and evolve APIs while keeping in mind. The session will involve a mixture of presentation and live coding to illustrate on how this works in practice.</p>

<div class="b-topic__info">


<p>Containers. Every manager thinks they want them, but few teams have experience in knowing what to DO with them. 
Used thoughtfully, containerization of your services can transform the way your organization thinks about testing. 
Gone can be the days of maintaining X different compute environments with Y different configurations. 
Imagine instead spinning up just the code you need, on the machine type it needs, and only for as long as you need it.</p>

<p>In this technical talk, Melissa will walk through what containerization means for a legacy code base attempting to
practice continuous integration and deployment, and provide key insight in to the sea change this provides for a testing
organization. Learn from practical, real-world examples about how testing practices and pipelines can be streamlined to
take advantage of the ad-hoc world of containerization. Come away with a real integration test plan that can reduce your
cycle times by an order of magnitude while increasing overall product quality. Unlock the power of testing… with
containers!</p>
