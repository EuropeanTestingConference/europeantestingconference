    <p><b>ETC 2019 Call for Collaboration</b>
<i>Other conferences call for papers or proposals. We call for collaboration.</i></p>

<p><b>TL;DR:</b> Propose an idea or outline for a session. We are selecting based on discussions via Skype/Hangouts.
Event: ETC 2019 in Valencia, Spain 14.-15.2.2019.
Compensation: Speaker travel expenses guaranteed by the conference.
Deadline: Submit by August 19th 2018.</p>

<h4>Our conference</h4>

<p>European Testing Conference 2019 takes place in Valencia, Spain February 14.15. 2019. The conference travels annually to different locations in Europe.</p>

<p>We are setting up the best practical testing conference that represents testing as different people know it: testers, developers, business analysts and managers. We recognize that testing is continuous, and we want to learn to do its different flavors better through sharing ideas and experiences in spirit of dialog. We seek to understand.</p>

<h4>Looking for sessions</h4>

<p>To find the right people to share in this conference, we want to collaborate with the existing and emerging speaker communities. We find our professional home communities to be those of agile and context-driven testing, and software craftsmanship, but actively seek to break the walls between them.</p>

<p>We want a good balance of European and non-European speakers and a good balance of craftsmanship and (exploratory) testing backgrounds.</p>

<p>We ask you to collaborate on three types of sessions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Talks of ideas with practical applicability (30 minutes)</li>
  <li>Demos of ideas in use – show and tell (40 minutes)</li>
  <li>Workshops of hands-on experiences for participants (90 minutes)</li>
</ol>

<p>We ask you to collaborate, because we believe the best results come out of working together. We want you to share your topic and excitement, and collaborate before you invest heavily in making the session final as a proposal.</p>

<p>We acknowledge we can’t fit all the great sessions there are. So we want to make it mutually efficient while enabling great content we as organizers would be unaware of. We believe there’s more value out of the collaboration than just our conference talk selection through getting to know one another.</p>

<p>When you respond to the call and we’re considering you, we’ll have a 15-minute Skype/Hangouts session with you to talk about your idea. If you get cut from consideration just for not having space in our talk budget for your type of idea, we’ll let you know by email. We expect the <em>finalized abstract from those who we choose, not as criteria of entry</em>. Timeframe for the discussions is August and September, and <em>this call closes on August 19th</em>.</p>

<p>What we have to offer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>entry</em> to participate and present at a great conference in Valencia, Spain 14.-15.2.2019</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>travel expenses and hotel</em> 3 nights reimbursed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Profit sharing</em> – we share ½ of the profits with the speakers. You get part of the honorarium pot that translates to money, based on the conference’s financial success and the length of your session</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What we expect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Speakers who can stay and participate for the duration of the conference. This is very important to having a great learning environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Come. Learn. Do. Teach. Test.</p>

      <h3><a href="/news/Conference-Is-Approaching">Conference is approaching!</a></h3>
      <p class="writer">27 Dec 2017 / Maaret Pyhäjärvi</p>
    </hgroup>
    <p>The year 2018 and thus European Testing Conference 2018 is approaching. Shall we meet in Amsterdam on February 19-20th?</p>

<p>There’s been a small change in our program, making it even more awesome and worthwhile to attend. Jessica Kerr has pressing reasons to cancel her appearance this year, and we replaced her with Pamela Gay, an American astronomer, a true inspiration.</p>

<p>Join us in Amsterdam and get your ticket today. All speakers have special discount codes, and they would love for you to reach out to them to introduce yourself in advance and ask for the code.</p>

      <h3><a href="/news/Announcing-Keynote-Speakers">Announcing Keynote Speaker for European Testing Conference 2018</a></h3>
      <p class="writer">10 Aug 2017 / Maaret Pyhäjärvi</p>
    </hgroup>
    <p>European Testing Conference 2018 proudly introduces our four keynote speakers:</p>

<p><b>Lanette Creamer</b> is a hands-on tester, bringing deep testing perspectives into the teams she works with as a test pilot - someone flying between projects. Her deep insights are summarized into a great talk titled <strong>Test like a Cat</strong> where we have a chance of learning ways to approach our projects in smart ways.</p>

<p><b>Pamela Gay</b> is an astronomer, who has her own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_L._Gay">wikipedia page. She runs a popular podcast and is amongst our keynotes as software (and quality considerations) are everywhere. She speaks with a title <strong>Testing v. Crowdsourced Data, or How I learned to stop worrying and Love the F-Bomb</strong>.</a></p>

<p><b>Gojko Adjic</b> is known for radical perspectives into how the world of software is changing, and seems a bit of a role chameleon. Being an absolutely inspiring person, he will share on a title <strong>Visual Testing</strong> with a talk of work he is doing right now. Paraphrasing him, it could be a success or failure, but the talk surely is something worth hearing and learning from.</p>

<p><b>Zeger van Hese</b> is a consultant and insightful speaker. Zeger represents skills one needs to be excellent at testing, regardless of one’s role. His talk titled <strong>The Power of Doubt - Becoming a Software Sceptic</strong> is brilliant.</p>

<p>Join us for enjoying their messages and many others in Amsterdam, the Netherlands in February 2018! We’re delighted to welcome our keynote speakers and look forward to enjoying learning with them in the conference.</p>
