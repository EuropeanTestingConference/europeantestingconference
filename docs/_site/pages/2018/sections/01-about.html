<p>Testing is important.
This conference is about getting experts and practitioners together to talk, learn and practice the art of testing. We’re looking into advanced new methods into making our testing more effective, as well as enrich our understanding of fundamental methods to grow a stronger community.</p>

<p>We’re tired of conferences that feel more like sales pitches than practitioners sharing the craft.</p>

<p>Come. Learn. Do. Teach. Test.</p>
