<p>When visuals come under test automation, the outcome rarely justifies
the cost. Visual tests tend to be too brittle, to difficult to
maintain, and too slow to execute for quick iterative delivery cycles.
However, recent improvements in cloud computing and browser
capabilities make it possible to change the economics of the test
automation pyramid. Gojko will talk propose a new view, looking at how
trends such as approval testing, cloud functions and automated image
analysis can help us automate acceptance/regression tests for visual
look and feel in a visual language, rather than xUnit style code, and
make such tests easy to write, understand, execute and maintain.</p>
