<p>Microservices is a way to organize your system that provides both opportunities and difficulties for testing. I recently worked with a company transitioning away from a monolithic architecture, and helped them to re-design their automated testing strategy for the new architecture. In this talk I’d like to share some concrete automated testing techniques that I found useful, including selective deployment, approval testing, and event monitoring. I’ll also relate some challenges we encountered enabling the teams developing the various services be able to test and deploy independently of one another.</p>
