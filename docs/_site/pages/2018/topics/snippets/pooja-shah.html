<p>Empower teams to help be on the same page and help ourselves in return for better focus on QA</p>

<p>In this talk, we will discuss about unleashing the power of existing systems like github, slack and some awesome open-source technologies to create a code monitoring and talking bot which can keep everyone across teams, up to date and be a helper in need by preventing/resolving the situation of conflicts. Will also be sharing exactly how I leveraged the power of existing systems &amp; created it and how this can be useful for many of your use cases at work.</p>

<h4 id="why-should-you-attend-this"><strong>Why should you attend this:</strong></h4>
<p>Imagine, it is one of your Release Day and the code started breaking all of a sudden, tested features not working anymore, and it is going to take time to figure out whom to reach &amp; people start passing the buck? Experienced such stormy sail on your release day? Amidst all this, losing time for release deployment as the traffic on your product is peaking up or exceeding the deadline promised to the clients. Manual monitoring doesn’t look a viable/scalable solution ? Yes, in fast paced organisations like us, it is a burning problem. Do you also feel the same?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Already nodding your head in agreement? Many times somewhere deep down, did you feel like escaping from the heated discussion or wished there were snapshots of all the important events which could give you the clues/traceback to hunt &amp; chuck the wrong commits out of the system and move ahead. Or even better some software which you could just hook to your system which would never let us reach such a chaotic state itself by blocking/notifying any wrong doings.</li>
  <li>Or are you someone just starting off your company and do not want to go through the same challenges we went through &amp; help your developers focus only on building the awesome stuff which you wanted to</li>
  <li>Or are you among those telling yourself “we have already solved it”. As a tech geek, are you excited to explore a different way as to how we are solving it?</li>
</ul>

<p>Eager to know how? Come let’s talk and take a sneak peek at how we are dealing with these at <a href="http://moengage.com/">MoEngage Inc.</a> And yes, get to start using the <a href="https://github.com/moengage/alice">solution open-sourced</a> in almost no time.</p>

<p>~ A little attempt towards making healthier work culture and keeping the smart brains happier :-)</p>

<h4 id="outline-of-talk"><strong>Outline of Talk:</strong></h4>
<p>The talk is about a bot which can help your team “preventing last moment panic moments” and so helps all the teams be on same page:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Problem analysis &amp; origin of the bot - 10 min</li>
  <li>The bot at your service - 13 min
    <ul>
      <li>with a live demo, we will discover, how we got our first bot live and then what more handy features it brought @ work, that it is like a team member now.</li>
      <li>The exponential future possibilities - 2 min</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Questions &amp; Answers - 5 min</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="key-takeaways"><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>An idea, which can empower each member in a tea and help bridge gaps across teams by bringing transparency of entire system with least efforts.</li>
  <li>An idea, how a little automation effort can prevent last minute panic moments at the time of release.</li>
  <li>You love robots doing your work and that too open-sourced? Join and know more insights of your interest.</li>
</ul>
