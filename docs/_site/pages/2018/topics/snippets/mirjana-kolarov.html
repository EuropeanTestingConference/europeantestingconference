<p>It’s not only developers job to monitor system performance, testers can learn and help also…
Performance and functional testing are things, we, as testers, talk about often. We write some
tests, execute them, get metrics, tune or fix system… and so on. But what happens when the
product goes “live”? Are we observing what is happening with it? Users have funny and
unpredictable ways of using a product. Are we aware how is our system behaving on production?</p>

<p>My daily job consists of monitoring our system in production and learning for it. In this talk I’ll
explain what added value a tester brings up in monitoring system, and what they can learn by
doing this. Some benefits include:</p>

<p>– oracles for our performance tests</p>

<p>– learning about system behavior</p>

<p>– observing (potential) errors in the systems</p>

<p>– preventing bugs getting to users before we fix them</p>

<p>I’ll show you which tools we use at our projects, how we use them and what can we see by
observing them all together, because one tool is never enough.</p>

<p>Key-Learnings:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Why do testers need to monitor performance of the system?</li>
  <li>What can a tester find out from those metrics and behaviours?</li>
  <li>Which tools can be helpful and how to combine them?</li>
</ol>
