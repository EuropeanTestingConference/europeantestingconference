<p>Come to this session to learn more about what we’re doing when we’re exploratory testing! If you know the theory of exploratory testing but sometimes have trouble articulating what you’re doing – or if you’d like to become more aware of the what and how of your testing, then this is the session for you. By doing live exploratory testing sessions with debriefs, we’ll examine how we approach exploratory testing, how we create and test our models, and how we can communicate what we’re doing to improve our testing itself, our communication about testing, and our sharing of testing knowledge.</p>

<p>The session is aimed at testers, developers, product owners, … – anyone who ever finds themselves challenging software to a testing duel 😊</p>
