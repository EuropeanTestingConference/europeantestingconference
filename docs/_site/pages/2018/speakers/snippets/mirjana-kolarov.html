<p>Mirjana is co-founder of the first testing community in Serbia, called Testâ€™RS Club (testrs.club).
After gaining diverse experience in testing she concluded that she needs to give it back to the
community, so she started one as a platform for sharing knowledge. During the day she is a
Test Architect and Department Manager at Levi Nine. But above all, she is passionate and
highly motivated software tester who loves getting her hands dirty with actual testing and leads
by example, promoting appropriate testing skills and techniques for 9 years, and counting.</p>
