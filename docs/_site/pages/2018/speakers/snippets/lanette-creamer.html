<p>Lanette hails from Seattle and combines a deep love of testing, glitter, kitties and terrible puns. Her test databases definitely have the highest incidence of cat pictures! Outside of work, she enjoys reading fantasy series, knitting and world travel. Her testing career began with a short contract that turned into 10 years of testing at Adobe, mostly working on InDesign and the Creative Suites, several years as an Independent Consultant, and currently works for The Omni Group as a Software Test Pilot.</p>
