<p>Abby is currently working at ThoughtWorks where over the last 6 years she has had the opportunity to work in a variety of domains, countries, and team dynamics. Throughout these experience it has become clear to her that while the technical requirements of each domain and tech stack can be challenging, team practices and team ownership have a much deeper impact on the end deliverable.</p>

<p>After 5 years of working on mainly web and desktop apps Abby has shifted into a more infrastructure and operations focus. Her goal is to help incorporate the same team practices that have success in software delivery to the infrastructure and tooling which supports that software in production.
