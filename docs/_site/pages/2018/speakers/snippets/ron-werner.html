<p>A C64 and Amiga veteran, Ron heard the distant calling of the Internet and got into programming websites in early 2000. Ever since graduating as a Master of Computer Science he’s worked in various technical IT positions. When he started testing, it clicked, and Ron fully concentrated on software quality in 2008. He then successfully built up browser and app automation frameworks and established test teams in Germany and the UK when working for conject AG, a leading international construction software company.
He now works in consulting as Mobile Testing Lead for QualityMinds in Munich. Next to building up a team of mobile testers he has been engaged in various exciting projects. As life’s luckily not all about work, he enjoys mountain biking and rock climbing as well as spending time with his wife and three sons.</p>
