<p>Having graduated in sinology, Lisi fell into agile and testing in 2009 and has been infected with the agile bug ever since. She’s especially passionate about the whole-team approach to testing and quality as well as the agile culture mindset behind it. Building great products which deliver value together with great people is what motivates her and keeps her going. She received a lot from the agile testing community; now she’s sharing her stories to give something of her experience back to the community. She tweets as <a href="https://twitter.com/lisihocke">@lisihocke</a> and blogs at <a href="http://www.lisihocke.com">http://www.lisihocke.com</a>. In her free time you can either find her in the gym running after a volleyball, having a good time with her friends or delving into games and stories of any kind.</p>
