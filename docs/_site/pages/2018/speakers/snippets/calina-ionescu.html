<p>Alina has been working over the last 10 years as a tester. She started on the usual path, during her years as a student, as a manual tester. She eventually started doing automated testing because she did not like repetitive tasks. In the last years she started working also on developer-related and dev-ops tasks. As a hobby she is interested in developing web and mobile applications written in React and React native.
She is one of the founders of the Timisoara local gathering “Tabara de Testare” (Test Camp) in Romania and one of the European Testing Conference organizers.</p>
