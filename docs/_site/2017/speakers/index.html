However I take the definition of terrific that is defined as “awesome” in description of my personality as a tester and that part of being terrifying (fear and awe) towards bugs and anything that degrades the quality of the product. I have a background in Electrical Electronics Engineering. My experience as a tester has been in the mobile industry and Medical technology. I have also studied MBA and MSc. in Electrical Engineering. The blend of MBA with testing profession empowers me with the possibility to leverage my testing skills with some level of business mindedness.
