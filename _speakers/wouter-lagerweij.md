**Wouter Lagerweij** is an independent Agile Coach operating out of The Netherlands. He loves spending time with teams and organizations to figure out how to improve the way they make software, and make it more fun. To make that happen he uses the knowledge and skills gathered in about eighteen years of experience applying Agile processes and practices from XP, Scrum, Kanban, Lean and Systems Thinking. To turn those improvements into real business opportunities, he's added Lean Startup/Lean Enterprise approaches.

Occasionally, he's even known to use common sense.
