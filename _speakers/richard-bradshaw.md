**Richard Bradshaw** is a friendly tester with a real passion for testing. Currently working as an Independent Tester after having set up Friendly Testing Limited in 2014, he has been testing for over 8 years now. He's a big advocate of automation, but not the silver bullet type, the type that really supports testing and testers. He is very technically minded and encourages the use of tools. He considers himself a student of testing and is always looking for new ideas and inspiration to improve his testing skills. He is active in the testing community, hosts #NottsTest in Nottingham, and co.counder of the Midlands Exploratory Workshop on Testing (#MEWT)
