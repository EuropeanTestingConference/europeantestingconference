<p>Chris had written code for many years, but was close to give up software after the hobby became a full-time profession - and with that, frustrating. Quality in the software industry felt too low, and people didn’t hug a lot. Gardening seemed nice enough. Luckily, they met the software craftsmanship community and made friends that share the passion and want to raise the bar. Today, Chris spends most time travelling to / organising unconferences such as SoCraTes and between that works as a contractor, trying to help clients improve their software development process and practices to a point where it can be both fun and profitable.</p>
