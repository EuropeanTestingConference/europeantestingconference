<p>A leader sets an example and inspires others to follow and then to lead in their turn. You don’t have to be a manager to be a leader—but if you’re not also a leader, you can’t be a good manager.</p>

<p>Inspiring testing means much more than getting a team to follow you. It means fostering teamwork that will enhance the effectiveness of your whole project team. It also means being a testing advocate.</p>

<p>In this interactive workshop, we’ll examine the skills and personal qualities essential for exceptional test leadership. You’ll have an opportunity to practice solving leadership problems, to assess your leadership aspirations and potential, and see how you can become the leader you want to be and bring benefits to all the projects you work on.</p>

<p>This workshop is for testers, test managers, test leads—anyone who wants to become a leader or a more effective leader.</p>
