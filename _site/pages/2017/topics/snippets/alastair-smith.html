<p>Learn how to make database development fun again, by applying all your favourite modern development practices to your SQL code!</p>

<p>Software is eating the world, but few apps are useful without a database behind them too. As such, we want to ensure our database code is well-designed and tested. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a good tool for software design, and as SPROCs are as much code as classes and methods, we can apply the same principles to unit test our database rather than integration test it via the app.</p>

<p>This talk will cover how to write unit tests for your database, which parts you should (and shouldn’t!) test, and how to run your tests automatically on a CI server, after which you will be able to write unit tests for your own SQL code and enjoy database development again!</p>
