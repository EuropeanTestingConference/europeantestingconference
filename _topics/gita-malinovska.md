Have you ever been in a project where in start of your testing you get an epic saying “Make the current design responsive”? Perhaps you don’t even know what it means in practice. How do you get started? How do you know when you are done?

In this talk I share my lessons on going through projects like this. We look at my first time testing a responsive website and a recent experience. You will learn to consider different environments; what things to test in practice; what tools to use; and how to deal with customer / designer to help the projects succeed.
