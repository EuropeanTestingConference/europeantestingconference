This is a tale of my journey als developer from hostility towards testers to subscribing to a software testing course. This shift happened over the last 7 years and helped me to discover a lot about myself. For a lot of people in the software craftsmanship community the “Tes” in SoCraTes was just added to make the name work. In case you haven’t heard about the software craftsmanship movement, just a little background. We believe in the values and principles described in the agile manifesto and we extend this. Working software, that is well-crafted; responding to change, while steadily adding value; individuals and interactions as part of a community of professionals; customer collaborations that lead to productive partnerships.
We are lucky in Belgium since we have at least one “Tes” at our SoCraTes conference and I truly feel grateful that this triggered a new challenge in my head. Why do we need separate communities and conferences? So our goal for SoCraTesBE 2016 is to reinforce the “Tes” in SoCraTes.
Within the agile community we have been pretty acceptant of analysts into our development teams. Maybe this is because we can better relate to what analysts really do. Maybe it’s because we feel the pain of not respecting the activity of analysing a problem. Maybe it’s because we truly feel the importance of analysis to help reinforce our development efforts.
Why do we have more difficulty in incorporating testing into our development teams. Let’s look at the same 3 Rs to do this: Relate, Respect, Reinforce.
If you want to know more about my journey, how SoCraTes became our new community name in Belgium and how we can RRR each other better and bridge the gap, join me and I’ll tell you my story.
